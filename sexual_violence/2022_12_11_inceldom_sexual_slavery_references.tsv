Well not that any of us advocate for this of course but enjoy your beatings, gang rapings, home invasions and being sold into sexual slavery en masse which is just around the corner ladies and remember this is the end result of the world you betrayed men for to help the Jews build.   So good luck with that and have fun I guess.   You were too good and too pretty and too intelligent and just too, too, whatever to date Elliot Rodger and guys like us and make us happy right?   Well now you get to date even worse “bad boys” than the usual ones that you’re attracted to.   In fact you won’t really even have much say in the matter.   Oh and guess what else? Unlike the unfair stereotype about incels not showering, these guys who you’re going to get very intimate with and very soon now? They won’t be able to take showers or clean themselves regularly if at all due to the upcoming scarcity of clean and or running water. https://youtu.be/X9USJgkruTw   View: https://youtu.be/ptH60ktLqBM	https://incels.is/threads/the-collapse-of-the-united-states-and-what-it-means-for-american-foids.351778/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_the_collapse_of_the_united_states_and_what_it_means_for_american_foids.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_the_collapse_of_the_united_states_and_what_it_means_for_american_foids.tsv	1643848632	Discussion The collapse of the United States and what it means for American foids.	225	8K	12

In it, he recounted his long history of rejection by women. In his 34 years, he said, the closest thing to a relationship he had achieved had lasted for only a couple of months in high school. “I’ve given up on the idea of ever finding a ‘significant other,’” he wrote. He told the other users that he had promised himself if he was still without a partner when he turned 40, he would either kill himself or be surgically castrated. “No, I’m not joking,” he added. XavierInTheForest titled his post “[Testimony of an Incel with Autistic Spectrum Syndrome](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Radical_Feminists/comments/cz7ijg/testimony_of_an_incel_with_autistic_spectrum/).” The term ‘incel’ is short for ‘involuntary celibate,’ and it has come to be associated with online communities of men who have lost any hope of finding a partner in the age of dating apps. The men on these sites obsess over their looks, exchange edgy memes and mine psychological studies for proof that the dating universe is viciously tilted against average-looking men. They sometimes call women ‘sluts’ or ‘whores’ but mostly refer to them as ‘femoids,’ ‘foids’ or even ‘female humanoid organisms’ — in other words, not quite human. XavierInTheForest is, in fact, a young man called Álvaro. (He declined to provide his last name because of the stigma of the incel label and the potential for it to harm his work prospects.) He wrote in the forum that he did not “condone in any way the ideas and abhorrent behavior of incels,” but he identified as one anyway. And as the title of his post indicated, he also identified as autistic: “My [autism] is pretty mild when compared to more serious cases, yet it’s still bad enough that my social skills are severely impaired.” Álvaro lives in South America, and in a photo he shared of himself, he has short, dark hair, brown eyes and a stippling of beard. He has struggled with insomnia, depression and anger issues. And in 2010, he was prescribed antipsychotic and antidepressant medications following a schizophrenia diagnosis, which he later came to believe was incorrect. Two years ago, another doctor told him he had schizoaffective disorder. Finally, last year, a psychiatrist diagnosed him with autism, which he says jibes better with his life experience. Apart from his limited social skills, Álvaro says his short stature — he is 5 feet 3 inches tall — has been a significant impediment to his finding a partner or even a temporary dalliance. “I am invisible to women,” he says. When he went back to college in 2014 to pursue a degree in translation, for example, he developed a crush on a classmate, but he says the young woman told him there was no way she could be attracted to him because of his height. “I decided to end the friendship because it was doing me more harm than good,” he says. Álvaro first heard the term ‘incel’ last year, when he was watching a video that mentioned Elliot Rodger. In 2014, Rodger killed 16 people and injured 14 others near a university campus in Isla Vista, California, before killing himself. Rodger — whose mother reportedly described him as a “high-functioning autistic child” in [divorce papers](https://radaronline.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/rodger-pages-wm-2.pdf) — left behind a widely shared manifesto blaming women for his actions. Álvaro was horrified by Rodger, but he was curious about what it meant to be an incel: Was he one? He began to research incels on Google and found their misogyny off-putting. “Those people are deluded,” he says. At the same time, he was becoming more and more alienated from women, whom he saw as speaking of body positivity and the tyranny of beauty standards, and yet demanding tall, manly partners. The isolation began to take its toll: “It’s psychologically and emotionally damaging to not have the connection with another person.” Álvaro began to seek answers on Reddit. Incels can be found pretty much anywhere on the internet that young men congregate: playing online games, trolling the comments threads of news articles and videos, and on social-media sites such as Reddit and 4Chan. One of the most popular incel forums, the [braincels subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/braincels), had more than 16,000 followers as of April 2018. The forum was banned last year for “posting content that harasses or bullies” people, leading users to scatter to other websites, including the now-defunct braincels.org, “a place for involuntary celibates to joke around, get support, shitpost, find friends and relax;” [yourenotalone.co](https://yourenotalone.co/), “a non-violent, gender-inclusive support group for involuntary celibates and allies;” and [incels.co](http://incels.co/) — women are “banned on sight, no exceptions.” These forums tend to attract a disproportionate number of autistic men. In an October 2019 [user poll](https://incels.is/threads/survey-results-for-october-2019.147774/) on the website incels.co, for instance, roughly one in four of the 550 respondents said they have autism. Certain traits of autistic people — a heightened response to perceived slights, a strong sense of social justice and difficulty understanding what others are thinking and feeling — may make them amenable to extreme views, says [Clare Allely](https://www.salford.ac.uk/health-and-society/our-staff/health-and-society-academics/clare-allely), associate professor of forensic psychology at the University of Salford in Manchester in the United Kingdom. The only social outlets for some autistic men are the internet’s anonymous echo chambers, so their exposure to toxic chatter may be extensive, she says. “It’s like a conduit to the outside world,” Allely says. “It’s no small wonder that they end up in all these forums and sites.” These sites are breeding grounds for hateful views, and spending time on them may be increasing these men’s detachment, diverting them from at least trying to expand their real-world social lives, she says. Some of the views may even encourage aggression or self-harm. Incels may refer to a happy couple in public as ‘suicide fuel.’ Another now-banned subreddit — the incelgraveyard — memorialized those who killed themselves. In the incels.co survey, two-thirds of the respondents said they had [considered suicide](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/hidden-danger-suicide-autism/), though it is unclear to what extent their time commiserating online contributed to these thoughts. Researchers are still trying to get a handle on the degree to which men with autism are influenced by the messages on these sites. They are also trying to determine what might attract autistic men to the extremist groups on the sites — with the hope of preventing or mitigating the attraction. “We’re all kind of anxious,” says [Rachel Loftin](https://www.rachelloftin.com/faqs), a clinical psychologist in Chicago, Illinois, who specializes in autism. “It’s a scary area to start to investigate.”    Lonely hearts: The term ‘incel,’ ironically enough, may have been coined by a woman. In the 1990s, a college student known only by her first name, Alana, launched a website called Alana’s Involuntary Celibacy Project as a forum for both men and women to seek support for their loneliness. She abbreviated it as ‘invcel’ until someone told her that ‘incel’ was easier to pronounce, according to a story published in 2018 on [BBC Radio 5](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-45284455). “It definitely wasn’t a bunch of guys blaming women for their problems,” she told the program. And yet that is exactly what most incels now do. With its cryptic lingo and inside jokes, the world of incels can be baffling to an outsider. Incels posit that when the sexual revolution of the 1960s freed women from monogamy, women focused their attentions on the most attractive men — ‘Chads’ — excluding lonely introverts with recessed chins and weak jawlines. “[Women] love Chad because Chad ensures her children will have favorable genes,” one user wrote on the braincels subreddit, providing a Darwinian explanation. “Just say it WOMEN ONLY DESIRE JAWLINE,” replied another. If a man is not attractive enough to be a Chad but manages to find a wife anyway, the incels deride him as a ‘normie’ and his wife as a woman past her prime. They commonly subscribe to what they call the ‘Blackpill,’ a view that their sexual success — or lack thereof — is determined at birth. The [Incel wiki](https://incels.wiki/w/Scientific_Blackpill?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=cea191e583161aae9a2b18027a9c6f57cb720ad7-1579045886-0-AS9-jBhvTG_llffe1aBZgznq2bMJ5SfoM0-81bTtYBbrVh2b3V4C3FI-hd71DvAxbVvvXZkQx06Vu_obUafBLPucRkr262WmafH58_vFHqJvEW9ioPKrJyscq42FjbGZgfx1-hQbholLBY9TDqi17QnkjJxXEXU73edpTg0casU06dwV9KKKrf037VenEQyilEqwa-Wpfb8fy8-a4yhGRKZf3UZBscT-960upeW674TLeBGbeh5PokUz_WKgwLQo4qoBMGT7XjV5UZpUbda1kqTD4MyUw60Fo0CqtMrdQyTf) includes descriptions of peer-reviewed studies in the fields of psychology and sociology that supposedly back up this belief. It paints a desperate picture of the sexual prospects of men whom incels deem to be not tall enough, wealthy enough or good-looking enough to attract women. One [cosmetic surgeon in Indiana](https://www.thecut.com/2019/05/incel-plastic-surgery.html) has become famous on incel forums for giving some members the kinds of faces they believe will increase their [sexual success](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/sex-foreign-words/). Although the websites offer a social outlet and affirmation, they also have the potential to amplify negative thinking and to encourage extremist and antisocial views. A [linguistic analysis ](https://organisms.be/downloads/incels.pdf)of the now-suspended [incels.me](http://incels.me/) forum estimated that about 30 percent of its threads were misogynistic, 15 percent were homophobic and 3 percent were racist. About half of all users posted hateful messages at least once, though a few prolific users accounted for most of the total. People who spend time in these forums become desensitized to the disturbing content, such as jokes about rape and sexual slavery, says Loftin, who, in addition to her clinical work, has served as an expert witness in legal cases involving incels. “The longer they are exposed to it, the more normal it appears,” she says. “The restrictive interests or the focus you see with somebody with autism could make them more susceptible to that.” On many of these forums, being a ‘sperg,’ a person with [Asperger syndrome](https://www.spectrumnews.org/wiki/asperger-syndrome/), is considered to be both a badge of honor and a ‘death sentence,’ a macabre reference to the [lower life expectancy](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/study-identifies-predictors-early-death-among-autistic-people/) of people with autism. (Asperger syndrome is [no longer a diagnosis](https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/people-mourn-asperger-syndromes-loss-diagnostic-manuals/) distinct from autism.) Autistic incels often refer to themselves as ‘mentalcels,’ a category that includes anyone struggling with mental health problems. The term ‘autistcels’ is also used, albeit less commonly. “Even worse than being ugly,” is how one autistic poster [described his plight](https://incels.is/threads/any-inkwheels-here-whos-life-has-been-destroyed-by-aspergers-high-functioning-autism.157023/) on incels.co. One meme [on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/virginvschad/comments/9ujew4/the_virgin_aspergers_vs_the_chad_autism/) contrasts a sort of Hollywood version of autism (‘The Chad Autism’) versus the reality for most (‘The Virgin Asperger’s’). Members allude to the scrawny virgin who “gives off school shooter vibes,” “will probably kill himself alone at 30” and “has stupid interests like World War II or politics.” The autistic version of a Chad, meanwhile, “memorizes entire books” and “girls think he’s cute.” The amateur psychology proffered in these forums is catnip to anyone who embraces black-and-white thinking, to which autistic people are particularly prone. Some of this scientific fodder reinforces their sense of inadequacy: “44.6 percent of high-functioning adult autistic men remain virgins, despite high sex/relationship drive,” reads one section on the Incel wiki, describing a [2017 study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5789215/). “Autists are judged as awkward, less physically attractive and less approachable within seconds,” reads a synopsis of [another 2017 paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/srep40700). The lead investigator of the latter study, [Noah Sasson](https://bbs.utdallas.edu/faculty/detail.php5?i=511), was dismayed to learn from Spectrum that his research was being used to support what he calls a “misogynistic and sophomoric” ideology, and says his work was misinterpreted. The study applies to both men and women and is not about women’s feelings toward autistic men, says Sasson, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Dallas. In a follow-up study, he and his colleagues found that neurotypical people’s [perceptions of an autistic adult](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1362361318824104) depend heavily on whether they know that the adult is autistic, are familiar with autism and have met the autistic person in question. “What this means is that negative judgments about autistic adults are in no way absolute and uniform,” Sasson says. The Incel wiki makes no mention of this more nuanced report. At the same time, there is no denying the profound sense of otherness that many autistic men seem to experience. “I kinda believe that if I talk a lot, I would reveal my inceldom and everyone will be disgusted,” an autistic Reddit user from Western Europe whose screen name is Growware told me. “Lacking in looks is a big handicap. And years of isolation and social rejection will eventually fuck with your mind as well.” In her private practice, Loftin says her strategy is to try to bring these people out of their online universe and remind them of their real-world experiences and connections. When she has had experiences with clients making remarks about sexual violence being overblown, she says, she challenges them to “do a little homework” by asking their family members about their experiences: “I have found that to be the most helpful way for people to shift their thinking in therapy.”  Nursing grievances: The third rail in any discussion about incels and autism is the potential for violence. Though rare, some incels have voiced a need to right the perceived injustices they face through a violent uprising. “The Incel Rebellion has already begun! We will overthrow all the Chads and Stacys!” read a [Facebook post](https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-43881931) on 23 April 2018 by a software developer named Alek Minassian. Later that day, Minassian drove a white rental van onto a sidewalk in Toronto, Canada, killing 10 pedestrians and injuring 16 others. Afterward, he climbed out of the van, pulled a dark object out of his pocket, and pointed it at a police officer as though it were a gun. He demanded that the officer shoot him in the head; he eventually raised his hands and allowed the officer to arrest him. Minassian attended [special-needs classes](https://torontolife.com/city/man-behind-yonge-street-van-attack/) in high school, and his mother [has been quoted](https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2018/05/11/i-was-like-how-did-he-get-a-van-inside-the-life-of-alek-minassian-the-toronto-van-rampage-suspect-no-one-thought-capable-of-murder.html) as saying her son has autism. During [a three-hour interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyHgtSy41VM) at the police station, he told a detective that he had spent time in incel forums, nursing a grievance against a woman who he said had rejected him years earlier. “I felt it was time to take action and not just sit on the sidelines and just fester in my own sadness,” he said. This desire for revenge for real or perceived wrongs is common in other groups as well. A Washington, D.C.-based think tank called [Women in International Security](https://www.wiisglobal.org/) has characterized the incel ideology as a form of [violent extremism](https://www.wiisglobal.org/publication/recognizing-the-violent-extremist-ideology-of-incels/) that overlaps with other forms of “militant misogyny,” such as white nationalism and jihadism. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has funded research about the role the internet plays in radicalizing incels. The study’s chief investigator, psychologist [John Horgan](https://cas.gsu.edu/profile/john-horgan/), has attributed 47 deaths in the past five years to the incel ideology and [called it](https://news.gsu.edu/2019/06/26/federal-grant-will-fund-research-into-growing-male-supremacist-subculture-online/) “nothing less than a new form of terrorism.” Incels say [such characterizations](https://news.gsu.edu/2019/06/26/federal-grant-will-fund-research-into-growing-male-supremacist-subculture-online/) are absurd. “[The researchers] are not interested in nonviolent incels and thus miss the bigger picture of large groups of men dropping out of society,” a user with the handle Ricecel X [wrote about the research](https://incels.is/threads/the-incel-community-is-one-of-the-purest-hotbeds-of-internet-radicalization-ive-ever-seen-says-the-man-who-got-a-grant-of-250k-to-study-incels.172893/). Still, although the latest [incels.co user poll](https://incels.is/threads/survey-results-for-october-2019.147774/) indicates that most incels believe they have been unfairly portrayed in the media, 13 percent say they agree that “incels are dangerous.” Logically, this characterization would include the subset of incels with autism — but the idea that having autism is a risk factor for violence is highly controversial. The Sandy Hook massacre in 2012 opened up a heated debate about whether, how and why people with autism might end up engaging in mass violence. In that tragedy, Adam Lanza, a 20-year-old on the spectrum, shot and killed his mother and 26 others, most of them children aged 6 and 7. Others followed, including Elliot Rodger in 2014 and Chris Harper-Mercer, who killed a professor and eight others in Oregon in 2015. Prompted by such incidents, Allely reviewed the histories of [75 mass shooters](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00223980.2016.1175998) for links to autism, using court transcripts and newspaper articles, publishing her results in 2016. For at least 6 of the 75 individuals, she found an autism diagnosis or at least a strong suggestion of autism, based on statements from family or doctors. The connection to autism is far from airtight, however. Spectrum’s own review of those shooters found that two of them — [James Holmes](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1359178919303283) and Seung-Hui Cho — were diagnosed with a suite of serious mental health issues, but never definitively autism. Cho shot and killed 32 students and faculty members at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 2007. He had been diagnosed with selective mutism and depression as a child but received a special assessment in high school to [rule out autism](https://web.archive.org/web/20081001180159/http:/www.governor.virginia.gov/TempContent/techPanelReport-docs/8%20CHAPTER%20IV%20LIFE%20AND%20MENTAL%20HEALTH%20HISTORY%20OF%20CHOpdf.pdf). And in a response to another paper Allely wrote on autism and terrorism, published in 2018, researchers at Sheffield Hallam University in the U.K. pointed out that many of the autistic offenders she tallied [had other conditions](http://shura.shu.ac.uk/21064/), including [attention deficit hyperactivity disorder](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/decoding-overlap-autism-adhd/), narcissism and intellectual disability. Lanza had experienced [depression](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/the-deep-emotional-ties-between-depression-and-autism/), [anxiety](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/unmasking-anxiety-autism/) and [obsessive-compulsive disorder](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/untangling-ties-autism-obsessive-compulsive-disorder/) as a teenager. Others noted that the diagnostic criteria of autism have no direct link to violence, and overall, autistic people are more likely to be the [victims of violence](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/how-abuse-mars-the-lives-of-autistic-people/) than perpetrators. “There is absolutely no evidence or any reliable research that suggests a linkage between autism and planned violence,” wrote the [Autism Society](https://www.autism-society.org/), an advocacy and support group based in Rockville, Maryland, in response to [media coverage about the Sandy Hook](https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/17/health/connecticut-shooting-autism/index.html) shooting. “To imply or suggest that some linkage exists is wrong and is harmful to more than 1.5 million law-abiding, nonviolent and wonderful individuals who live with autism each day.” Allely says her goal is not to stigmatize people with autism, but to understand the extraordinarily rare instances when they resort to violence. She says people with autism are more likely than other people to have mental health issues. In a 2017 study, she and a colleague [analyzed Rodger’s case](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359178916301744?via=ihub) using the “Path to Intended Violence” model. This model is designed to distinguish ‘howlers,’ who utter threats but are unlikely to commit actual violence, from ‘hunters’ who may actually carry it out. Rodger was unusual in that he had both extreme narcissism and autism, which Allely characterizes as “an explosive combination.” Autism, she says, may play a role in creating the grievance but may not be the critical factor that later leads to violence. Some data point to an association between autism and [low self-esteem](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15374416.2017.1381912?journalCode=hcap20), and interviews with people who have engaged in terrorism suggest that they are drawn to it not just by their sense of being slighted, but by a profound need to matter in the world.    Combating angst: It was clear from reading Rodger’s manifesto that he felt he did not matter to women, according to Allely. He described spending hours in cafes and bookshops, but apparently he made no attempt to ask anyone out on a date, presumably because he did not know how. Deterring violence depends on preventing the grievances about such isolation from taking root, Allely says. “This stands to highlight the need for education early in school on how to interact with others in a social and romantic way — what’s appropriate, what’s inappropriate and when you should back off,” she says. “That’s something schools don’t do.” For instance, a program in the Netherlands called[ Tackling Teenage Training](http://www.researchautism.net/glossary/1479/tackling-teenage-training-programme) offers young people with autism private counseling to improve their sexual knowledge. Other programs offer [sex education to autistic adults](https://www.spectrumnews.org/opinion/viewpoint/why-adults-with-autism-need-sex-education/). Some researchers are investigating how autistic people find extremist online communities, with a view toward preventing their participation. Loftin, for instance, is working with researchers in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. to use [machine-learning](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/can-computer-diagnose-autism/) techniques to identify autistic posters in anonymous online forums. Their goal is to identify some of these individuals and interview them to find out what draws them to the incel forums and keeps them there. Loftin says she hopes this work, along with her other research, will help the team create a model for assessing the risk of violence in the autism community and to help families recognize and intervene when a loved one is moving toward extremist thoughts. Meanwhile, the internet community is also at least partially policing itself. The subreddit [incels without the Hate](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelsWithoutHate/) seeks to “provide a positive and helpful community” for people who have struggled to find intimacy. And then there is [IncelTears](https://www.reddit.com/r/IncelTears/), the “part-mocking, part-watchdog subreddit,” which was created to counter what it called “hateful incels” and had more than 346,000 members as of late March. IncelTears often challenges incels on their dubious claims about autism, such as the idea that women with autism have a much easier time than men in the dating world. It also offers a counterbalance to the negativity found in such forums. Álvaro posted his own experience not in a forum for incels but in a subreddit for radical feminists. He says he chose that forum because he thought he would get more constructive feedback there than he would have anywhere else. He did find it enlightening to interact with women who had faced harassment and abuse at the hands of men and had still found a safe place in a troubled, damaged world. “They are honest, sincere and open to self-criticism,” he says. “That’s the thing I’m looking for in a woman.” The best advice he says he got from them? “Get off social media.” I reached out to Álvaro again in January to see how he was doing, and he told me he now has a female friend in his city who is a vegan like himself, but he still does not have any romantic prospects. He is working with a psychologist to help him be more assertive and communicate better, and he has had some sessions with a speech therapist to make him sound less, as he puts it, “robotic.” Part of him still wants an intimate relationship, but he says he is also feeling at peace with the possibility that it may never happen. As for Reddit, he had stopped using it, he says, and was trying to go out and socialize more — until the coronavirus hit. These days, he has found himself in the same place as so many other singles, staying home, swiping right on Tinder and hoping for a match.	https://incels.is/threads/spectrumnews-org-jfl-radical-online-communities-and-their-toxic-allure-for-autistic-men.203879/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_spectrumnewsorgjflradical_online_communities_and_their_toxic_allure_for_autistic_men.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_spectrumnewsorgjflradical_online_communities_and_their_toxic_allure_for_autistic_men.tsv	1589397869	News [SPECTRUMNEWS.ORG(jfl)]Radical online communities and their toxic allure for autistic men	30	3K	0
15	1640302352	TheNEET	Sooo… a guy gives murderer vibes because he likes camping and he's a piece of shit for respectfully saying that they don't fit together, because they clearly don't, because he likes doing stuff in the outdoors while the foid is a self-admitted couch potato?  Reminder that if an incel said that he's introverted or prefers to stay indoors, he'd be called a piece of shit, sissy, told that that's why he's incel etc. etc. Of course, people are allowed to like different things, but it seems that men are expected to have hobbies, but they also really can't have any, because they may accidentally hurt a kween by enjoying stuff she doesn't enjoy.  This is so insane that I struggle to paraphrase their line of thought, because it doesn't follow any logic or intuition known to a man.   There is a subreddit that's supposed to make fun of FDS by reposting the worst takes and writing their own parody posts, but it's not really active, because the actual FDS is as insane as it gets, you literally can't make that shit up.

Or at least better looking. Why go with someone like me? Why would my looksmatch or lower want me when superior men are available? Sure, Chads might not commit and only do hookups but at least these women can date normie to upper-tier normie guys. If a woman who was ugly and a total loser like me can be in a relationship with a well-adjusted 6’2 guy (maybe not Chad but still quite decent), there is zero reason for me to ever be considered.  I don’t even want to force a woman to be with me. A government given gf like in the memes would probably suck, and an arraigned marriage would as well. Because she would never be happy with me, like me, be attracted to me. Why would I want to be with someone who doesn’t like me that I like them? Why would I wanna have sex with a woman who deep down doesn’t want to with me?  Like even if rape or sexual slavery were legal I wouldn’t do it because none of those would give me what I want. I don’t want to force a girl to be with me. And this isn’t even mentioning the moral issues I have with those things (yeah I think rape and sexual slavery/trafficking are horrible things, deal with it). Like I still find what ISIS did to Yazidi women to be fucking disgusting. Yeah probably very unpopular here but I don’t give a shit. I just want to be loved and wanted. Which will never happen. So I’ll just have to learn to accept it or end my life.   And I sure as hell am never gonna go ER. Because like Raphaël from Houellebecq’s Whatever once said, “Blood changes nothing.”  Maybe you think I’m trying to get crumbs of pussy or appealing to IT, but I’m not.

In rape you are not getting any form of intimacy or validation from a woman. You are literally forcing yourself onto a woman that doesn’t want you and hurting her. There is no emotional connection. There is no bonding. You’re not even getting validated in feeling attractive enough to where she wants you. Even if rape was legal I would have zero interest in it. I don’t think I will ever understand why any incel would be pro-rape or okay with it. Same with sexual slavery, human trafficking, and arranged marriage.

And the idea that everyone be liberated is flawed. We are still bound by our socioeconomic conditions in this neo-liberal world. I don't believe in breaking the chains. I believe in changing them for everyone's benefit. Just like we moved from slaving to wageslaving(which is more benign) females could be moved from sexual slavery in the hands of patriarchy to another system that enforces breeding with us upon them. (though I see nothing partucularly wrong with patriarchy). Liberation is a myth.    You'd be surprised at the number of guys on this forum who would love that.  As someone who has lived in a resource rich shithole, I agree. The same will happen in the west with influx of cheap immigrant labour and machines replacing the civil society. I don't see a bunch of sand niggers launching a communist revolution in Germany.  Yup, we are victims of degeneracy yet some guys here are filthy degenerates themselves. It comes down to the fact that a lot of them live in first world.

0	1581430956	Iamnothere000	(cucked disclaimer: everything below is just theoretical rambling, I’m a good boy who respects women, I promise)  TL;DR: The real incel rebellion is the constantly increasing sexual trafficking.    When I first heard of the concept of the incel rebellion my mind was immediately filled with apocalyptical scenes:  Gun wielding manlets would roam the streets, shooting everything that is female or cucked. Communication and infrastructure would collapse, destroyed by disgruntled STEM- and wage´cels. Emotionally dead gymcels would hunt down and strangle the life out of their former bullies and hoist the bodies from bridges and lamp poles while the bully’s former girlfriends tremble in fear and submissive arousal.  Army and Law Enforcement would be totally apathetic, unwilling to risk their lives just to defend the ungrateful masses who hate them anyway unless they need protection.   (side note: I’m writing this in the same room with my boss who is having a job interview with my next possible coworker, he thinks I’m working hard on our next medical software tool, this arouses me)  However, as cathartic and amusing such scenes would be (in Minecraft), as unlikely are they to actually happen, at least for now. The number of incels that actually realize their situation is yet too small. Too high is the inhibition. Too comfortable are the copes. And incels are too socially stunted to develop the necessary pack-mentality to coordinate such an endeavor.  For the foreseeable future, the incel rebellion will have to be content with small singular acts of hERoic resistance (which shall also only ever be realized in Minecraft).   But there is another way in which the consequences of rampant hypergamy and whoredome manifest themselves: …sexual trafficking.  About 70% of trafficking victims are female. [https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-human-trafficking](https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-human-trafficking)  Human trafficking is taking on “horrific dimensions”, despite growing efforts, awareness and attention by government, human rights and feminist groups.  [https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1029912](https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/01/1029912)  Sexual trafficking, as an expression of the incel/beta rebellion, has several key differences in comparison to the scenario above:  -incredible difficult to counter -no concerted effort necessary, just a hand full of low inhibit-individuals (don’t even have to be incels)  -social life and infrastructure stays intact, our copes are save -low public awareness, no panicking normies  A textbook example of this scenario unfolding would be china, where the high gender imbalance leads to an ever increasing demand for sex slaves. And since such activity does not disturb the highly conformist society of china, this trend will only continue. I am willing to bet that the Chinese government is actually fine with sexual trafficking for the benefit of the countless supernumerary men as it keeps (the most aggressive of) them docile and averts the demographic crisis the country is heading into.  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_China#Sex_Trafficking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_trafficking_in_China#Sex_Trafficking)  (To be fair, the Chinese situation was mainly caused by the retarded one child policy but the result is the same as with female hypergamy: Men with no girlfriend/relationship/marriage/family prospects)   Some people, especially the fine gentlepeople at IT, might argue that women should be able to behave as they want (within the bounds of the law) without suffering the thread of sexual slavery. For those people I would like to lay out the basic facts:  Men want sex/offspring. Women can provide this. Men are stronger than women. Harming something is way easier than defending something.  The rest is just social negotiation.	https://incels.is/threads/discussion-sexual-trafficking-is-the-real-incel-rebellion-beta-uprising.177839/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_sexual_trafficking_is_the_real_incel_rebellion_beta_uprising.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_sexual_trafficking_is_the_real_incel_rebellion_beta_uprising.tsv	1581430956	[Discussion] Sexual trafficking is the real incel rebellion / beta uprising.	49	2K	0

0	1554847732	Crookout25	I just want to clarify some bullshit that I always read about inceldom and Islam   First of all, Sharia law allows only 4 wives and slavery, especially sexual slavery, is permitted. Islam is a religion where conquering other people to spread the religion is particularly important. During a war, the muslims have the right to take any female of the enemy they want and turn them into a slave, while killing the males. The women are then distributed among fighters and may be even sold. This has historically provided muslims with a more than enough source of women even despite their polygamy.  Second of all, it doesn't matter in Islam if you are Chad or not, because your ability to marry will be only based upon your status, income, and religiousness. So you might just carreermax, religionmax, have a good job, and pay the dowry to the foid's dad who is, according to islamic law, not supposed to judge you based on your looks but on your religiousness and status. The father wants to improve his family's status and reputation by giving his daughter to a man who has a good status and reputation. Thus, the only incels will be either poorcels or sincels (who might still buy slaves).   Theoretically, yes, but in practice, they never refuse a husband because of the huge family pressure. You really think Islam would still be where it is today if women had the choice to marry who they wanted ? Obviously no. What we call Hypergamy in the west will just be traditional class privilege in an islamic world, because the woman is assimilated to merchandise.    Theoretically, yes, but in practice, the risks of getting caught, executed, and the fear of going to hell is so huge that this happens only exceptionnally. A foid that's been raised according to islamic standards will be reminded very frequently since childood of her fate if she pursues such ideals. You might see that there are still a lot of adultery execution videos on the internet, but most of them show old footage and the total number of women executed represent practically nothing compared to the total number of the female population    Those are muslims in the West. In an Islamic country, the blackpill wouldn't exist because you would only have failed at statusmaxxing, which is also more fair than your life being over because you were born ugly. At least every one of us would have a chance, and even if you still fail at statusmaxxxing, people won't hate you for it, because it could happen to anyone.    Because these things didn't exist back then when Islam was created, and since it is a religion that adapts really slowly to the outside world, there isn't yet a consensus on how they should handle the women acting like thots on the internet. But every islamic scholar says that the woman should be as discrete as possible. When the foids start crossing the line, that's when real islamic thot patrols will be created and will clean up all the mess because a man having his daughter or sister exposing herself on the internet carries a social stigma worse than being a cuck.	https://incels.is/threads/there-is-no-inceldom-in-islam.116622/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_there_is_no_inceldom_in_islam.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_there_is_no_inceldom_in_islam.tsv	1554847732	Serious There is no inceldom in Islam	14	750	0

It would be installed through a safe, pain-free procedure with a failure rate of less than 10% through exhaustive testing on irredeemably defective subjects. It would cure them of their cluster B personality disorders, allowing them to assess the attractiveness of themselves and others more fairly, improve their listening and communication skills, and empathize with their life partners, all without the need for negative reinforcement.  In fact, 'sexual slavery' wouldn't quite be the right term for it with this sort of arrangement in place, as their participation in the system would be voluntary and without cruelty, not to mention how vulgar the term is. More accurate would be terms like 'equitable companionship' or 'shared sexual liberty'.

32	1541456522	lessthanhuman	 The woman has to prove that the allegations she makes against her husband, which is of course very difficult for her. Furthermore, a woman who divorces her husband is shunned by her community, although to be fair shame falls on both parties for having divorced. And there is a stigma against divorced women, which in a system where women are financially reliant on men, makes divorce even more unthinkable for her.   Hypergamy is indeed a female biological trait, but the circumstances in the West are unnatural in that women can freely fuck attractive men infinitely, and without consequences. Having sex with Chad over and over again makes a woman feel completely entitled to such attractive men, even if she is ugly herself. On the other hand, if a woman never gets a chance to fuck Chads, yes she may feel attracted to them, but she realizes they are out of her league, and with familial pressure and social humiliation for unmarried women, she will be forced to simply marry her looksmatch. This was what happened throughout history, and even ugly men got to reproduce with their ugly looksmatches because they were forced by society to lower their standards, especially as they couldn't fuck Chads anyway.   Currently yes because we are living in a Western-dominated world, but historically sexual slavery was a huge thing in the Islamic world, and even a man with limited wealth and social status could buy a slave if he saved up for one. For example, in the Ottoman Empire, the price of a female slave was very affordable for a middle-class man, and even a working class man could buy one if he saved up for her.	https://incels.is/threads/oh-lord-we-asketh-thy-forgiveness-as-we-doth-not-wanteth-to-beest-forsaken-from-thy-barakah.86935/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_oh_lord_we_asketh_thy_forgiveness_as_we_doth_not_wanteth_to_beest_forsaken_from_thy_barakah.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_oh_lord_we_asketh_thy_forgiveness_as_we_doth_not_wanteth_to_beest_forsaken_from_thy_barakah.tsv	1541374213	RageFuel Oh Lord!

So for example, if Stacy were your sex slave, she would be forced to open her legs to you so you could enjoy yourself sexually.  However, as society is now, you're forced into tax-slavery to give Stacy a comfortable life so that she can open her legs to Chad and thereby enjoy herself sexually. That makes you a sex slave.  And yet, CuckTears says we're the bad guys for wanting to force femoids into sexual slavery. See how one-sided they are?

37	1519339399	LDPE	Quran Quran (4:34) - 'Men are the maintainers of women because Allah has made some of them to excel others and because they spend out of their property; the good women are therefore obedient, guarding the unseen as Allah has guarded; and (as to) those on whose part you fear desertion, admonish them, and leave them alone in the sleeping-places and beat them; then if they obey you, do not seek a way against them; surely Allah is High, Great.' Contemporary translations sometimes water down the word 'beat', but it is the same one used in verse 8:12 and clearly means 'to strike'.  Quran (38:44) - 'And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with it, and do not break your oath...' Allah telling Job to beat his wife (Tafsir).   Hadith and Sira Sahih Bukhari (72:715) - A woman came to Muhammad and begged him to stop her husband from beating her. Her skin was bruised so badly that it is described as being 'greener' than the green veil she was wearing. Muhammad did not admonish her husband, but instead ordered her to return to him and submit to his sexual desires.  Sahih Bukhari (72:715) - 'Aisha said, 'I have not seen any woman suffering as much as the believing women'' Muhammad's own wife complained Muslim women were abused worse than other women.   Sahih Muslim (4:2127) - Muhammad struck his favorite wife, Aisha, in the chest one evening when she left the house without his permission. Aisha narrates, 'He struck me on the chest which caused me pain.'  Sahih Muslim (9:3506) - Muhammad's fathers-in-law (Abu Bakr and Umar) amused him by slapping his wives (Aisha and Hafsa) for annoying him. According to the Hadith, the prophet of Islam laughed upon hearing this.  Abu Dawud (2141) - 'Iyas bin ‘Abd Allah bin Abi Dhubab reported the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) as saying: Do not beat Allah’s handmaidens, but when ‘Umar came to the Apostle of Allah (may peace be upon him) and said: Women have become emboldened towards their husbands, he (the Prophet) gave permission to beat them.' (This is graded sahih - authentic. It is also reported in Sunan Ibn Majah 9:1985, also graded sahih) At first, Muhammad forbade men from beating their wives. As the hadith indicates, he rescinded this once it was reported that women were becoming emboldened toward their husbands. Beatings in a Muslim marriage were deemed necessary at times to keep the woman in her place.  Abu Dawud (2142) - 'The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: A man will not be asked as to why he beat his wife.' The authenticity of this chain of narration is characterized as daif (weak), however, a similar verse from Sunan Ibn Majah 3:9:1986 is said to be hasan (sufficient).  Abu Dawud (2126) - 'A man from the Ansar called Basrah said: 'I married a virgin woman in her veil. When I entered upon her, I found her pregnant. (I mentioned this to the Prophet).' The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: 'She will get the dower, for you made her vagina lawful for you. The child will be your slave. When she has begotten (a child), flog her'' A Muslim man thinks he is getting a virgin for a wife, then finds out that she is pregnant. Muhammad tells him to treat the woman as a sex slave and then flog her after she delivers the child. (Despite multiple chains of narration, this hadith is graded as daif).  Ibn Ishaq/Hisham 969 - Requires that a married woman be 'put in a separate room and beaten lightly' if she 'act in a sexual manner toward others.' According to the Hadith, this can be for an offense as petty as merely being alone with a man to whom she is not related.  Kash-shaf (the revealer) of al-Zamkhshari (Vol. 1, p. 525) - [Muhammad said] 'Hang up your scourge where your wife can see it' Notes Contemporary apologists often squirm over this relatively straightforward verse from the Quran (4:34) - which gives men the right to beat their wives if they have even a 'fear' of disloyalty or disobedience. Their rhetorical aerobics inspired us to write a separate article:   Wife Beating- Good Enough for Muhammad, Good Enough for You  Others are not nearly as squeamish. Sheikh Yousef al-Qaradhawi, one of the most respected Muslim clerics in the world, once made the famous (and somewhat ridiculous statement) that 'It is forbidden to beat the woman, unless it is necessary.' He went on to say that 'one may beat only to safeguard Islamic behavior,' leaving no doubt that wife-beating is a matter of religious sanction. (source)  Dr. Muzammil Saddiqi, the former president of ISNA (the Islamic Society of North America), a mainstream Muslim organization, says it is important that a wife 'recognizes the authority of her husband in the house' and that he may use physical force if he is 'sure it would improve the situation.' (source)  Sheikh Dr. Ahmad Muhammad Ahmad Al-Tayyeb, the head of Al-Azhar, Sunni Islam's most prestigious institution says that 'light beatings' and 'punching' are part of a program to 'reform the wife' (source).   CAIR's Dr. Jamal Badawi endorses corporal punishment as 'another measure that may save the marriage' (source). He doesn't make clear how striking a woman will make her more inclined to staying with her assailant, unless Badawi is implying that teh beating instills a fear of more serious consequences should if she attempt to leave.   Egyptian cleric, Abd al-Rahman Mansour, said in a 2012 televised broadcast that, in addition to discouraging the wife from filing divorce, beatings would inspire the wife to 'treat him with kindness and respect, and know that her husband has a higher status than her.' (source)  During Ramadan of 2010, another cleric named Sa'd Arafat actually said the woman is 'honored' by the beating (source). No one else seemed terribly surprised or upset by this.  An undercover report from progressive Sweden in 2012 visited 10 mosques and found that 6 actually advised beaten women not to report the abuse to the police. These women were also told that they must submit to non-consensual 'sex' with their husbands. (source)  In the birthplace of Islam, about half of Saudi women are beaten at home. 'Hands and sticks were found to be used mostly in beating women, following by men’s head cover and to a lesser extent, sharp objects.' (source)  In 2016, the Council of Islamic Ideology proposed a bill - ironically named the Protection of Women against Violence Act - that actually included exceptions for 'lightly beating' defiant wives. (source)   According to Islamic law, a husband may strike his wife for any one of the following four reasons: - She does not attempt to make herself beautiful for him (ie. 'let's herself go') - She refuses to meet his sexual demands - She leaves the house without his permission or for a 'legitimate reason' - She neglects her religious duties Any of these are also sufficient grounds for divorce.  Respected Quran scholars in the past interpreted verse 4:34 with impressive candor. Tabari said that it means to 'admonish them, but if they refused to repent, then tie them up in their homes and beat them until they obey Allah’s commands toward you.' Qurtubi told wife-beaters to avoid breaking bones, if possible, but added that 'it is not a crime if it leads to death.' (source)  Muslim apologists sometimes say that Muhammad ordered that women not be harmed, but they are actually basing this on what he said before or during a battle, such as in Bukhari (59:447) when Muhammad issued an order for all the men of Qurayza be killed and the women and children taken as slaves. (Having your husband murdered and being forced into sexual slavery apparently doesn't qualify as 'harm' under the Islamic model).  But, in fact, there are a number of cases in which Muhammad did have women killed in the most brutal fashion. One was Asma bint Marwan, a mother or five, who wrote a poem criticizing the Medinans for accepting Muhammad after he had ordered the murder of an elderly man. In this case, the prophet's assassins literally pulled a nursing infant from her breast and stabbed her to death.  After taking Mecca in 630, Muhammad also ordered the murder of a slave girl who had merely made up songs mocking him. The Hadith are rife with accounts of women planted in the ground on Muhammad's command and pelted to death with stones for sexual immorality - yet the prophet of Islam actually encouraged his own men to rape women captured in battle (Abu Dawood 2150, Muslim 3433) and did not punish them for killing non-Muslim women (as Khalid ibn Walid did on several occasions - see Ibn Ishaq 838 and 856).  In summary, according to the Qur'an, Hadith and Islamic law, a woman may indeed have physical harm done to her if the circumstances warrant, with one such allowance being in the case of disobedience. This certainly does not mean that all Muslim men beat their wives, only that Islam permits them to do so.	https://incels.is/threads/heres-exactly-what-we-need-to-do.24337/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/heres_exactly_what_we_need_to_do.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/heres_exactly_what_we_need_to_do.tsv	1519332775	Here's EXACTLY what we need to do	38	935	37
0	1517266186	TickleTheWalrus	Narcissism - This is the biggest part of it. Incels generally believe that they are 'good' people and that they have so much more to offer a woman than your typical 'Chad.' There's often a heightened esteem for their own attributes, most often intelligence, well beyond what is actually merited. A lot of it is they've believed they were special or amazing most of their young lives and they now believe that to such a degree that they feel they don't have to do anything to get the kind of love and affection they want.  They genuinely feel they deserve a relationship for the sole fact that they exist. They don't feel like they should have to work on themselves and grow as people. For them, sex and relationships is just a given. It's not something you have to work for.  This idea that they're 'nice guys' is intrinsically tied to their personality and their view of themselves. The reason they revert to shrieking whenever someone questions their 'nice' credentials is they tie that to their value as a person; 'nice' is 'good' and 'good' is worthy of love, if you question the 'nice' then you are implying they are not good people and therefore not worthy of love.  Part of that is developing plans rather than just letting things happen and people be people. When they approach someone, chances are good they've already spent time thinking about that person and they've developed a 'plan' for how things will go. Sometimes it's just a plan to have sex or it can be as much as plans to date or marry and have kids. They see things go a certain way because they want it to and then when they're rejected it hurts doubly because the woman didn't follow the plan.  To be fair, a lot of people have this problem. Incels just weaponized it.  Lack of self awareness - Most incels are painfully lacking in awareness. I can almost guarantee you the guy in the OP pic would have no trouble saying that to someone's face because they don't know that it sounds absolutely insane. For them, these things make sense because they feel wronged. They don't understand why they aren't getting what they think they deserve and instead of sitting down and saying 'Hmm...well I refer to women as 'femoids' and straight-faced advocate for government supported sexual slavery and that's probably creepy as hell, maybe I should revisit why I believe these things' they think 'There's nothing wrong with me! It's other people who are the problem!'  I have yet to see someone who voluntarily identified as an incel say 'Yes, I have scary views on women. I don't know how to handle that.' Most incels who eventually realize that their crappy ideas about people and women are what gets in their way the most eventually stop becoming incels. Shockingly, once you stop treating other people like meat they actually like you more.  Misogyny - Most incels will claim to be 'good' people with regards to how they treat women but if you really listen to how they treat and talk about women, their definition of 'good' boils down to 'I don't just smack any woman who annoys me and I don't abduct and rape them.' They don't actually treat women well and a lot of them come out with stuff that would make James Bond tell them to take it down a notch.  Most incels view women as inherently inferior to men or, at bare minimum, that men are somehow more intelligent/practical/rational/reasonable etc than women and that women need men to survive. If you talk to incels about relationships it becomes crystal clear that they have no idea how to actually respect another person despite believing they do.  They also generally believe the woman they are owed should be 'a 10.' I've never seen a group of people so picky and demanding of potential partners. A lot of them have these wishlists of characteristics that range from the creepy to the outright insane and it highlights nicely that what they're looking for is a pet they can stick their dick in, not a partner.  It's also part of why anime is such a prevalent interest in the incel crowd. Anime presents these perfect incel women; virginal, submissive, non-threatening, and sexually open. Interest in anime itself doesn't necessarily equate to inceldom but I've yet to meet more than a handful of incels that weren't really into anime.	https://incels.is/threads/is-this-an-accurate-summary-of-incels.17809/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/is_this_an_accurate_summary_of_incels.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/is_this_an_accurate_summary_of_incels.tsv	1517266186	Is this an accurate summary of Incels?	0	287	0

So when you have to join one of these groups to try and create change in your life, it is just an admission that you yourself are helpless to getting what you want and let other people walk all over you. Like I never see chads or rich people support these kinds of things. It is always weak men who support them.  I'm not saying that people shouldnt be ideological, but it has to be more sensible. Here's an example. One of the things mens rights groups always seethe about is divorce rape. This just makes them look weak because they admit they are being divorce raped. A stronger man who has more control over his foid wouldnt have this problem. A good ideology is like how I support all foids being forced into sexual slavery. It's not a problem in my life because I am already getting sex with prostitutes. But I support it because it would be be the best for me.	https://incels.is/threads/hard-to-swallow-edition-why-male-advocacy-mens-rights-groups-are-a-complete-waste-of-time-society-needs-male-disenfranchisement-to-survive.396715/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_hard_to_swallow_edition_why_male_advocacy_mens_rights_groups_are_a_complete_waste_of_time_.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_hard_to_swallow_edition_why_male_advocacy_mens_rights_groups_are_a_complete_waste_of_time_.tsv	1659666889	Blackpill [Hard To Swallow Edition] Why Male Advocacy & Men's Rights Groups Are A Complete Waste Of Time (Society Needs Male Disenfranchisement To Survive)	46	2K	39

11	1650468639	H2Ocel	This is all hypothetical feds The main proposed 'silver bullet' solution are sex robots, which if able to atleast replicate the appearance of emotion would make foids obsolete, although I don't think we're anywhere near realistic sexbots. Maybe in a few more decades, 2050. Although I'm personally skeptical of these advancements. In the meantime, if we wanted to implement actual changes then we'd have to launch a social revolution to basically abolish gynocentric social practices (reverse sexual revolution). I don't think there is any solution to foids under current modern Western systems. While I don't think traditionalism fully addresses the concerns of incels and it has inherent gynocentric values, a return to familial-clan systems which enable arranged marriage. It will atleast return the sexual market from the current foid monopoly back to a practice of men trading their daughters based upon SMV for other benefits (arranged marriage was historically basically used for families getting some financial or social benefit for letting jr sex their daughter). You'd also have to introduce punishments against adultery and dissuade divorce. Another, more modern, solution in my view could be state-mandates girlfriends. I know people bring this up a lot without elaborating so this is how I see it. Women would be paid on a government contract to be the partner of incels. They could be matched by a computer based on a variety of factors including look-matching and actual 'compatibility' factors (eg: ethnicity, religion, lifestyle) or just by sortition. Women on s[UWSL]uch a contract would have relatively more rights than women not on one who'd basically be low-class citizens. The women would be required to adhere to the contract, so no cheating, sleeping around, etc, or they would both lose those rights and be punished. You could monitor this by having their male partners log info about how the foid treats him (might violate the guys privacy though). Also the state could then reward obidient foids who stay in shape for their husband, have sex with him regularly, be nice with him, etc.[/UWSL] [UWSL]Elliot also had his own system in his manifesto, but it might be either to extreme or to idealistic for some people.[/UWSL] [UWSL]in general though for any change, women would need to lose power. You could also bring back sexual slavery (in Minecraft, no I dont support this) or something and have incels buy and sell GFS on a market.[/UWSL] [UWSL]Society would 2000% need to be patriarchal, without any gynophile or gynocentric elements.[/UWSL]	https://incels.is/threads/incel-political-program.368974/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/theory_incel_political_program.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/theory_incel_political_program.tsv	1650465520	Theory Incel Political Program	14	272	11

567	1670805470	Deafcel88	Welcome back, @MarquisDeSade.  Good news, to further fuel our collective misanthropy, it is reported that it is fundamentally impossible for this entire world of developed nations to escape the fate of 1 quadrillion dollar (up to 2.5 quadrillion) derivatives bomb.  Derivatives bomb is what precipitated Wall Street meltdown in 2008.  When this quadrillion dollar bomb explodes, it makes the Great Depression in the U.S. look like the grim Disneyland ride.     Further information, but some paywall and lightbox bullshit to nix. Use the web site 12ft.io as a tool to defeat paywall, sometimes it doesn’t work. Only a preview of what’s to come.  The Unavoidable Crash​ [Banks ranked by derivatives](https://www.usbanklocations.com/bank-rank/derivatives.html)  Let the communist fat fuck Michael Moore try to make sense of it:   View: https://youtu.be/SAkcSB_yGDo    View: https://youtu.be/RblJanBbqXo    View: https://youtu.be/fLGMxH9KFa8   A primer for how derivatives bomb imploded Wall Street that required the corrupt government (Congress and Prez Dubya) to bail out the irresponsible Wall Street fat cats by shaking down the Average Joe Taxpayer, below. Long article but better than having to go to bullshit college to take Economics 101 and still get charged for outrageous tuition, expensive textbook and hidden fees whilst struggling to get a B or better.  Recipe for Disaster: The Formula That Killed Wall Street​ When the derivatives bomb explodes, this is the fatalistic point of no return as one of many scenarios, such as nuclear warfare.  In particular, following the scenario of derivatives that explodes around the world in domino effect like “economic supernova”, ‘beauteous’ women—corrupted by total feminist cuntery that lends to the intolerable and snobbish attitude, being extremely choosy of the men who might or might not take her hand in marriage to fuck, procreate, birth children, being loyal to the breadwinner husband to rear the family so to be happier—who has rejected and mocked us for the misfortune of being hopelessly poor and unemployable or underemployed incels will deserve the horrible fate of being the sex slaves to be subjugated to the endless train of gangrape and rough fucking, with the possibility of being slaughtered post-orgasm, as the bestial invading Mongrels, Japs and Soviets did to the women and girls eons ago.  The horrendous fate also holds true for the selfish “superior” men (i.e. boomers and “Chad Thundercock”) who will be stunned, and cannot escape somewhere to survive. It will be like “The Road + Lord of the Flies” shit.  I wish the few humble and wise men (incels or not) good luck (edit: bugout offgrid locations, if one can even afford) to withstand the derivatives supernova scenario, if this will be the mother of all cataclysm that will cause massive riots and famines, with the consequence of the horrors a la “The Most Dangerous Game” in hunting the males to torture and execute (if not sparing for use as slave labor) and the females to capture and abduct to force into sexual slavery to rape, even some unfortunate females being raped to the death like what happened in Nanking 1937 (Japs sexually mutilating, torturing and raping/gang-raping Chinese females to death) and St Domingo (now Haiti) in 1791 (slave revolt Negroes gang-raping French colonialist females, including mulattos, to death). Innumerable unimaginable horrors to come should the entire world collapse in derivatives bomb all over that precipitates the greatest depression in history. Bleakest outlook for mankind, almost 8 billion idiot people of all races dead as slaughtered by governments for being useless, destroyed by marauding bands of bloodthirsty and cannibalistic thrill-kill thugs (who might fight each other over owning the surviving females for sexual slavery, or sharing for gang raping then slaughter to dispose like the used-up whores they are), and starve to death by collapsed system logistics leading to mass famine that is the equivalent of Holodomor—ten thousand times worse in terms of global impact.
