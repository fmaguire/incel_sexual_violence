0	1625348296	TheNEET	Krytyka Polityczna is a Polish leftist journal. Radical enough not to be considered mainstream, but it's also not some obscure bulletin, it's quite well-known.  The article is all nihil novi for us and it's way too long imho, but it's probably the fairest (not perfect, obviously) look at incels from a non-incel perspective I've came across so far.  Linguistic note: the term 'loser' ('przegryw') is how Polish incels often call themselves, it's not meant to be demeaning when used in this article.    How I betrayed the feminist cause and went over to the incel side​If a man calls himself a loser, it probably means that there is real suffering behind it. When someone is excluded for some reason, telling them that they have themselves to blame should certainly not be a strategy of the left.  When I announced on my social media that, after several years of advocating for women, I was going to lean into the problems of young men who identify as incels and losers, it proved controversial on both sides. Some feminists have accused me of siding with the enemy, normalizing misogyny and making deals with potential rapists. I've also read that just bringing up this topic is spitting in the face of victims of violence that I have supported in the past.  The incels, on the other hand, wondered what was going on. Am I a Trojan horse trying to inspire confidence and then ridicule their community or, in the footsteps of most journalists who have covered this topic so far, portray them as terrorists and psychopaths?  The suffering of incels​Incels are men who live in involuntary celibacy - they would like to have sexual relations but face obstacles that prevent them from doing so. Most of them share the conviction that the main reason for their anguish is their physical unattractiveness. There are also those who see the source of the problem in their low social status or in their mental illness (the latter are called mentalcels).  They are most often remembered by the media when, somewhere in the United States, where the incel community is at its most radicalised and also politicised, linked to Trump and the far right, they commit sexual assaults or murders, plan extended suicides, publish manifestos in which hatred of women is intertwined with a range of the most insane conspiracy theories.  Although extremists prepared to put words into practice make up only a tiny fraction of those who identify as incels, there is no denying that the forums where they meet are saturated with misogyny. I do not underestimate the danger this poses or the harm it causes. But I do believe that all negativity has very specific causes that need to be looked at and tools sought to help us minimize it in the future. Because it is the people who suffer - rarely by deed, often by word - who are hurt, but it is also the people themselves who suffer. Hatred is born out of frustration and a sense of injustice, and violence breeds violence. Even when the enemy is misidentified.  The Polish incel environment differs significantly from the American one. It gathers supporters of all political options, from fascists to communists, without pointing to any particular party (although Konfederacja certainly has a lot of support among them). Most - although to varying degrees - adhere to genetic determinism, that is, they believe that the traits that distinguish men and women have been shaped by evolution, and that cultural changes cannot alter our nature.  Like the American ones, they are divided into several factions, the so-called pills (it's Matrix-inspired). Recently, the media have become interested in so-called losers, i.e. those who believe they have failed in all spheres of life, not just the romantic/sexual sphere.  They are the ones behind the 'experiment' of creating fake profiles on Tinder and insulting girls who are tempted by a handsome man's photo. They belong to different pills, but most identify as black - blackpill means there is no hope for them. It's a sad, rather nihilistic vision in which only the beautiful and rich have a chance at happiness, while physically unattractive men from the lower classes are doomed to eternal loneliness and rejection.  Why only men? Because it is women who, in their opinion, have too high demands and dream of handsome men, and handsome men are so indiscriminate (and virile) that - even being in the minority - they are able to satisfy them all. Blackpillers use interesting but often questionable research, usually in the field of evolutionary psychology - an interesting but controversial field whose methodological basis is disputed by a multitude of male and female scientists. However, it is an academic field whose development is worth watching.  Understanding a 'loser'​The logic of the losers is more or less like this: women are hypergamous by nature and therefore seek a partner with a social status higher than their own, while men tend to do the opposite. Once upon a time, when the only acceptable model for romantic-sexual relationships was monogamous marriage, often entered into out of convenience, and women could choose from a small group of candidates from the surrounding countryside, everyone had a chance to form a relationship.  Women's equality, the sexual revolution of the 1970s, the weakening of the institution of the patriarchal family and the popularization of dating apps have raised women's expectations of their potential partner - they are less and less dependent on men financially, they do not have to grab the first one who will provide for the family. Instead, they attach more and more importance to appearance, and apps allow them to compare men from all over the country, and even from beyond its borders.  We mainly compare photos, so ugly men are out of the running. Why not women who deviate from the beauty canon? Because men - although they pay attention to their appearance to the same degree - are more willing to make compromises (in other words: they are more willing to lower their standards just to get laid).  According to the losers, the blame for this situation lies not only with women, but also with chads and simps - the former are handsome men who go for quantity, not quality, in their choice of partners, sleeping with not only models, but also girls much less attractive than themselves, the latter are all those who feed women's egos, trying to live up to the still widespread belief that it is the man who should take the initiative, which in turn makes women aim ever higher. Standards can be raised overnight, but adjusting to them is more difficult.  There is no evidence that women are 'naturally' hypergamous - evolutionary psychologists can only conclude that they tend to be hypergamous, but they do not have the tools to investigate to what extent this is an evolutionary adaptation and to what extent a product of patriarchal culture. Interestingly, studies show that in countries where the gender pay gap is smaller, women are less likely to seek partners with a status higher than their own. And the fact that young men are having less sex today than they did ten or twenty years ago is explained by the fact that they are marrying later - as a rule, people in formal relationships have sex more often.  Nor is there any evidence to support the theory that a small percentage of the most attractive men satisfy the needs of an increasing number of women - but US studies show that the most active 20% of men in this category account for 50-60% of all sexual contacts, a figure that has not changed over the years.  Although incels like to exaggerate, and in the selection of quoted studies choose those whose results fit a given thesis, often confuse correlation with causation and put too much trust in evolutionary psychology - their problems do not come out of nowhere. There is not enough data to look at them in detail, but we do know that there are more men than women born from generation to generation, that they leave villages and small towns less often than women, that they go to university less often, and that they live with their parents more often than women. And I think that these are issues worth looking at.  Many incels are immersed in nostalgia for times gone by, and feminists rightly accuse them of longing for the opportunity to wield power over women's bodies and believing that sex is simply their due, even though only American extremists came up with the idea of forced sex work camps. Most incels I spoke to don't even recognize the use of paid sex - they want desire from the other side, an affirmation of their worth, not a transaction.  While I condemn all measures aimed at restricting women's right to make choices about their own bodies, I am far from minimizing the problems of sexual frustration, unmet need for intimacy or loneliness.  My interest in incels divides feminists. Some claim that I have been manipulated, believe in neurosexism and harm women. It is no less controversial among incels - my aim has never been to reconcile these communities. But I do believe that it is always worth considering how to reduce the amount of suffering in the world, the source of which is too often a blindness to harm that is not ours and that is harder to imagine.  And a huge proportion of these guys are really suffering - nobody chooses an identity loses for fun. Unless it's the trolls, who - as many interviewees have told me - make up the majority of the most popular users on sites like Wykop, sowing ferment and manipulating the rest of us.  The limits of empathy​The empathy of feminists who give good advice to incels is equal to that of Bronislaw Komorowski suggesting young people change jobs and take a loan or Beata Pawlikowska recommending running and drinking orange juice for depression. Just get off your ass and stop being a loser, ok?  'I'm not going to bend over backwards for people who fantasize about murder and wonder what brought them to this point, because absolutely everything that happens to incels also happens to girls,' - says in the new episode of her vlog Kasia Babis, artist and influencer, and recently also a youtuber, referring to the discussion that arose after my posts on the subject.  I do not force anyone to bend to incels. I don't remember urging Kasia Babis or anyone else to do so. Under the feminist umbrella there is, or at least should be, room for all those who will leave their contempt for women and minorities to soak in. I've tackled this topic because it interests me, and I don't think that being male protects you from experiencing systemic harm. I would also like to prevent the scenario in which larger and larger groups of Polish men reach the point Kasia mentions coming true.  I suspect that the girls were led to the conclusion that Polish incels dream of murder by articles describing this phenomenon in the USA and calques from them appearing in the Polish media. Meanwhile, on Polish incel forums, there are no plans for extended suicides, mass rapes, no adoration for Elliot Roger - the famous American incel assassin, no fantasies about pogroms. Instead, there are teenage boys who fantasize about their deaths because they consider themselves to be 'genetic scum', worthless individuals.  Most incels realize that physical deviation from the beauty canon is not their only problem. They write about poverty, the inability to move away from parents, a problem that currently affects more than 40% of young men and - according to the incels - is one of the markers of a 'life loser', as it makes it even more difficult to establish relationships.  They also talk about hard work at 'Januszex', a private company of a Polish exploiter, rejection by peers, bullying at school, low self-esteem, loneliness, mental disorders - depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia are the most frequently mentioned. They talk about social phobia and the autism spectrum. They don't have money to see a psychotherapist, the queues at the National Health Fund are up to two years, and they hear from their parents that they should get a grip and 'grow some balls'. However, they can only count on media attention when they give a justifiably appalling display of misogyny.  Love disappointment vs. pounding the wizard​The culture we live in tells us that sexual success is an indication of our worth. Sex sells everything, from TV series to roof tiles, and we increasingly and boldly share our conquests with friends and even online. A woman no longer has to wait until marriage to 'throw off the garland' without being ostracized, and in Western societies the cult of 'virginity' is - fortunately - consigned to history.  The pressure to have a rich sex life, which is beginning to affect women, has been one of the markers of 'real' masculinity for centuries. This is why I believe that sexual frustration and, above all, the loneliness that incels talk about but that boys also feel, are problems that are not worth ignoring.  Belittling them with claims like 'everyone falls unhappily in love sometimes and you have to cope' can provoke the righteous rage of a man who, with other incels, celebrates on Wykop a 'wizard's impalement', i.e. a thirtieth birthday without experiencing sexual contact and often even a kiss or hand-holding.  Words hurt, especially when the person saying them is an attractive, popular girl and the recipient is a boy with a receding jaw, crooked bite and alopecia areata who reaches her shoulder and has no money for a dentist.  Babis and her colleague Marta Nowak rightly point out that it is hard to imagine women, convinced of their physical unattractiveness, taking revenge on random men by setting up fake profiles in dating apps, insulting them or staking them out. But already mocking short guys or small penises is an increasingly common phenomenon. 'A man starts at 185 cm' - such claims are not uncommon in descriptions on Tinder or women's Facebook groups, and sometimes they go beyond that.  The lack of a sex life is increasingly being mocked, probably all of us from the left-wing bubble have heard jokes based on the belief that 'ponies ['kuc', a slang for a long-haired guy, originally associated with metal fans and tech enthusiasts, nowadays mostly with supporters of Janusz Korwin-Mikke, a right-wing politician and the leader of the right-ring party Konfederacja] don't fuck'. Not having sex is something particularly shameful, especially for men, because it strikes at the myth of the male conqueror.  Babis and Nowak put the incels' frustration down to the fact that beautiful women don't want to have sex with them - which ultimately proves that they know about them as much as they know about girls. The loser, meanwhile, does not dream of an Instagram model, does not barricade himself in his dark basement because someone has broken his heart once or twice, but experiences constant rejection and Tinder displays the message: 'You don't have any likes! Check to see if there's anything wrong with your profile'.  Often he doesn't even have friends, anyone with whom he can go out to people, and at work he can only meet a drinking buddy. Add to this introversion, extremely low self-esteem and mental disorders, and 'getting out of the basement' can be beyond his strength.  It makes me wonder if an incel who, due to a genetic disease, is less than a metre tall and in a wheelchair, like one of my interlocutors, would also be told by youtubers to just 'change his mentality' because he 'condemns himself to being a basement-dweller'.  Many actually do what they blame women for - they target partners from the 'upper league', expecting a lot and offering little, and at the same time judging women's beauty very harshly, eagerly ridiculing being overweight or having a 'too high' forehead. However, many dream of arousing desire in any girl and getting positive feedback at least once.  In a series entitled Harlequins for Losers, a Wykop user called Blackpill_RAW, until recently Poland's foremost theorist of 'black pill' ideology and unofficial king of the incels, has described a number of injustices they face. These humorous, though undoubtedly misogynistic stories contain explicit criticism of social inequality, worker exploitation or junk employment.  Mirek, the main character and loser, looks with envy at Oskar the Developer, his privileged class position, an easier start, an expensive car, time and money to adjust his body to the current canon of attractiveness. The author recognizes the problem of class conflict, although he does not call it that.  The plot of all the stories is simple and repetitive: circumstances and even historical periods change, but the reader can be sure that the 'alpha male', that is Oskar or Klaudiusz Deweloperski, will enjoy life's success, bathing in a sea of young female bodies, while Mirek will spend another evening in solitude, indulging in compulsive masturbation and dreams of a grey mouse who will love him selflessly.  And when Mirek, using an anonymous account, pours out his grief online, he hears that if he stopped hating women, he would have no problem getting into a relationship. Another solution often proposed is: 'Incels should be sent to therapy'. - yes, universal access to quality psychological and psychiatric care would improve the situation for some and, incidentally, the condition of society as a whole, but what about when mental disorders are the result, not the cause, of rejection, frustration and loneliness?  However, the most lacking in empathy and one of the most common pieces of advice given to losers is: 'take a shower' or: 'go to the hairdresser/gym'. - because most of them apply the so-called lookmaxing, doing everything to bring their appearance as close as possible to the current canon of attractiveness. The possibilities are limited both for economic and genetic reasons - a boy who is 165 cm tall, has a backbite and a posterior mandible cannot do much about it. It is also significant that the most widely available ways to improve one's appearance without much effort, such as applying make-up or growing hair, are still culturally assigned to women.  As for the claim that all the problems that affect incels also affect women - it is questionable whether height discrimination or lack of means to go on a date are problems that affect us equally. There is still a widespread belief that it is the man who should take the initiative and even pay for the woman.  Downsides of having a penis (they exist)​Women are socialized to be polite and submissive, which is the basis of patriarchy, but a sensible feminist should not quarrel with the fact that men are under more pressure to prove themselves worthy of belonging to their gender, and the vulnerability they show is less likely to be met with understanding and compassion. It is more difficult for men to reach out for help or even to express and name emotions. It is more difficult for them to accept defeats, because defeat strips them of their masculinity, which in the popular image requires a thick skin, resourcefulness and independence.  When a few years ago I wrote a report about people who come to organisations fighting for tenants' rights for help, they were almost exclusively women. Whenever I went to meetings where people with eviction orders could get free legal help, there were dozens of women waiting in line, men were rare. The activists told me that this is almost always the case, perhaps because men often feel that the inability to provide for their families is the ultimate stripping of their dignity. Asking for help is like admitting this.  This is why in crisis situations they break down more easily, endure loneliness less often, fall into alcoholism more often, and commit suicide - the latter seven times more often. I met many strong, brave women, victims of wild reprivatization and gentrification, who fought the tenement owners on their own because their husbands couldn't stand the psychological pressure.  The fact that it is generally more difficult to be a woman does not mean that there is not a larger or smaller group of men who are really screwed. It is easier for a man to make up for beauty deficits with self-confidence, a sense of humor, and social status, but when all through adolescence he has received feedback from the world that he is ugly or 'different', and no one has ever shown him a shadow of sexual or romantic interest - self-confidence and a sharp wit can be hard to come by.  The incels I spoke to included people on the left and the right, those who denied and openly admitted to misogyny, people with disabilities and transgender people, differing in everything except their experience of loneliness, lack of acceptance and drastically low self-esteem. To reduce them all to potential murderers is simply wrong-headed, although it is tempting to brush the problem aside, to wash our hands of it.  Should they blame themselves?​The left should not shift responsibility for systemic problems onto individuals, regardless of their gender or views. The longer we ignore the real problems of incels, dismissing them as a group of dangerous, wannabe murderers of women, potential rapists, the more likely they are to become so. For now, they are venting their frustration, calling women 'foids' [in the article they use 'locha', meaning a pregnant pig, the term is used by Polish incels just like the term 'foid'], making fun of 'feminists' bollocks'.  I am a feminist, but I realize that I am far more privileged than the vast majority of people, if only by virtue of where I live, cultural capital, family support, beauty reasonably in the canon, lack of serious mental disorders and much more. They do not feel privileged, and the fields of exclusion are different, gender being only one of them.  I believe that systemic problems that also affect men are important and serious. However, I am not saying that it is the responsibility of feminists to address them, although I would like us to pay more attention to issues such as economic exclusion or mental health, which affect all genders.  I would also like to encourage, or at least not discourage, men from acting in their own interest, from dealing with problems which concern them more than they do us - such as the growing number of suicides or the threat of homelessness. Yet these are issues raised almost exclusively by conservative, anti-feminist movements and 'men's rights' organisations which blame women for their plight.  If a man calls himself a loser and a beta male, it probably means that there is real suffering behind it. Telling such a person that he should not complain because he belongs to the privileged sex seems to me an insensitive attitude. When someone says that they are excluded for some reason beyond their control, telling them that they are to blame, and pointing to isolated examples of people who have managed to overcome adversity, is not a strategy that is likely to be of long-term benefit, and certainly should not be a strategy of the left.	https://incels.is/threads/a-fairly-reasonable-article-about-incels-in-polish-media.304475/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_a_fairly_reasonable_article_about_incels_in_polish_media.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_a_fairly_reasonable_article_about_incels_in_polish_media.tsv	1625348296	News A fairly reasonable article about incels in Polish media	41	4K	0

0	1642661441	bonesmashing	There are two ways to go about this, both of which make the SJW/soy/cuck/FDS/POS seethe because both stick it to them very hard.  Basically, if rape or forced sex is so terrible, why is there such a lack of footage? The internet has always been the reservoir for the most sick of the sickos to get their jollies off on disturbing stuff. Endless stomach turning gore, brutality, dismemberment, Mexican chainsaw shit, etc. So much shit out there can be so gruesome even I would say to myself, 'Fuck this. I'd rather watch Pokemon or some shit.' There is TONS OF CONTENT -- ALMOST ENDLESS -- of violence/snuff/brutal gore videos in hordes. Sexual assault videos? Much less common. Either men or people in general are AFRAID of this and thus value or see the act of sexual violation as worse than the act of sickeningly gut turning torture + to be less despicable than such (which values the opposite sex SO HIGHLY that you'd say tortuous, sick-shit gore on the net is not as bad as being jumped out of a bush and penetrated to forced orgasm in a mere 30 seconds probably), which SAYS A LOT about how people view sex vs. violence.  If it's SEXUAL violence to a mild-degree it's WORSE than even the most shocking content of generic gore you can find ... What does that say? It either says rape isn't THAT BAD like the normies make it out to be, or that people value some body parts SO HIGHLY that they consider rape or forced sex to be worse than mutilation/beheading/dismemberment while alive & kicking. See either way the SJWs lose because they either gotta admit rape isn't that bad, or that some people are so highly valued for in some ways that an act of forced sex (even with no generic violence done during such whatsoever) is WORSE THAN THAT EXTREMELY SICK SHIT YOU SEE ON GORE SITES. Is a woman's hole so mighty that forcing yourself in it for 30 seconds is WORSE than chopping a poor Mexican guys body parts off one-by-one LIVE ON CAMERA (and cutting his vital organs to visibility/trauma WHILE ALIVE AND CONSCIOUS) until his death is NOT AS BAD? A dick in an orgasmic pussy is worse than dismembering a poor man? I get the 'forced' aspect, BUT FUCKING COMPARING STRAIGHT-UP FORCED/BRIEF PENETRATION (with the caveat of orgasm/please & maybe falling in love with this 'attacker' too) WITH GRUESOME SHIT YOU FIND ONLINE, most of which is DONE TO SUFFERING, LOW-VALUE MEN?  The internet is for the sickest shit out there that's common. The SJWs/soys/etc. say rape is so common yet so evil ... Okay, but not evil enough to see and bear with it? I can see the evil in those gore videos ... Where are all of these rape videos then, by these endless supposed rapists? I see psyops here ... If you have too much proof something isn't as bad as it seems, won't that drastically blackpill some? Murder is seen as the worst thing yet ... But kill some ugly Mexican and people watch it 'for science' by the thousands ... A guy indirectly 'forces' and his 'victim' orgasms faster with him than with Beta Billy and ... guess what ... this is 'worse' than those gore videos you can find out there? Can you show me the gore footage of those poor (99% men btw) victims in them orgasming? Yeah, didn't think so. You can't have it both ways, or no good ways you cucks: either a woman's holes are valued more than most men's lives that a minor, forced experience of being sexually diddled is worse than the most gruesome of gore videos online, or you admit these 'heinous rapes' actually aren't that bad/more akin to assault/battery, NOT SICK TORTURE.  I am just spitballing here as I clearly don't have any intentions to try & rape or harm even a fly.  But really think this through ...

They are upset because of their backwards ideals yet still want to push them onto earth everyone.  it’s rules for thee; but not for me. It’s not about getting even or being equal or seeing a brighter tomorrow. It’s all about getting more than the other person, in this case it’s normies getting one over on incels. You see by withholding their relationships while also demonizing those who attempt is a way to gaslight us into inceldom permanently.  It’s a no win situation and they set it up to be this way. There is no way that if your friend was a giga Chad that it would be creepy. They would be falling all over an older male figures like young sluts do. It’s only because he wasn’t sexually attractive to them so now it becomes a problem.

And also, as you can see from the below image (download it), a 13 year olds brain is mature enough as the scan shows that they have more blue areas than red and yellow which means they have enough cognitive ability to consent to sex with an adult. Remember, 13 year olds know right from wrong, and they also know what they want, so if they want to have sex with an adult, they can. The only reason they would end up “traumatized“ is because evil feminists like you like to CONVINCE young girls that any sexual contact between an older adult is rape/sexual assault even if they gave their consent and enjoy it.

0	1643506422	RoastieBeef	26-year-old transgender who, during her teen years, sexually assaulted a child has been sentenced to a juvenile facility and won't be required to register as a sex offender.  Last November, Hannah Tubbs admitted in court that in 2014 she sexually assaulted a 10-year-old girl in a Denny's restaurant bathroom in Palmdale, California. She grabbed the child by her throat and put her hand down her pants, continuing the assault until someone else walked into the bathroom, the Los Angeles Times reported. At the time of the assault, Tubbs was 17 years old.  Tubbs was arrested for an unrelated crime in 2019 at which time her DNA was put into a national database. It was that DNA that allowed investigators to identify and charge Tubbs with the earlier sexual assault. Tubbs was arrested and charged with molestation in 2021. The decision to imprison Tubbs in a juvenile facility falls under the office of Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón, according to Judge Mario Barrera.  Presiding over Tubbs' custody hearing on Thursday, Barrera said that prosecutors with Gascón's office never filed a motion to have Tubbs' case transferred to an adult court. In an adult court, she would have faced a longer prison sentence inside an adult facility.  At the Thursday hearing, L.A. County attorney Justin W. Clark argued that the court could allow the Probation Department to decide to imprison Tubbs in an adult facility. Clark pointed to a California law stating that people over the age of 19 should be incarcerated in an adult facility.  Barrera disagreed, stating that an amendment to the law restricts his ability to reassign Tubbs to a different facility.  	https://incels.is/threads/26-year-old-transgender-who-sexually-assaulted-a-10-year-old-child-will-spend-2-years-in-juvenile-facility-not-required-to-register-as-sex-offender.350750/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/26_year_old_transgender_who_sexually_assaulted_a_10_year_old_child_will_spend_2_years_in_juvenile_fa.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/26_year_old_transgender_who_sexually_assaulted_a_10_year_old_child_will_spend_2_years_in_juvenile_fa.tsv	1643506422	26 year old Transgender who sexually assaulted a 10 year old child Will Spend 2 years in Juvenile Facility, not required to register as sex offender	9	564	0
0	1644180574	PPEcel	Three weeks ago, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Eleventh Circuit unanimously ruled in favor of three sex offenders whose First Amendment rights were violated by the sheriff of Butts County, Georgia.  You can read the full decision here:   Background   [](https://incels.is/attachments/gary-long-1-jpg.572565/)  In October 2018, Sheriff Gary Long instructed his deputies to place the following sign in front of the homes of all 50+ registered sex offenders under his jurisdiction. The sign was accompanied by a pamphlet that stated (incorrectly) that sex offenders in Georgia were not allowed to celebrate Halloween, and that removing the sign would lead to their arrest.  [](https://incels.is/attachments/screenshot-2022-02-06-201415-png.572564/)  Three sex offenders, Corey McClendon, Reginald Holden, and Christopher Reed, soon filed a federal class action lawsuit alleging that the sheriff violated their First Amendment rights.  [](https://incels.is/attachments/trick-treat-1-jpg.572567/)  While the federal district judge granted a preliminary injunction in their favor, the same judge later ruled that no First Amendment rights were violated and granted summary judgment in favor of Long, arguing that the signs were covered under the government speech doctrine, not the compelled speech doctrine.  Compelled Speech Doctrine  [](https://incels.is/attachments/ga_atlanta_elberttuttlecourt-jpg.572566/)  The Eleventh Circuit disagreed. The district court's judgment was reversed. Their reasoning was simple: the First Amendment “includes both the right to speak freely and the right to refrain from speaking at all.” Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705, 714 (1977).  The compelled speech doctrine dates back to West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943). In Barnette, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to force schoolchildren to recite the pledge of allegiance. 'If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein.' Id. The federal courts have since considerably expanded this principle in the intervening decades.  Noting that the sheriff cited exactly zero instances where a registered sex offender in his county utilized trick-or-treating or Halloween as a ploy to commit sexual assault, the appeals court held that Long's actions easily failed strict scrutiny.  The Eleventh Circuit understood what should be common sense to everyone who even remotely understands First Amendment jurisprudence: it is plainly unconstitutional for the government to coerce a private individual into conveying the government's speech. By forcing sex offenders to place a yard sign whose content they disagreed with, on their property, the sheriff blatantly violated the First Amendment.  Why do I care about this case, you ask? The answer is simple: civil liberties are counter-majoritarian. There is no need to defend popular speech or popular individuals. By upholding the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights despite their unpopularity, the federal judiciary reaffirmed its commitment to the rule of law, as opposed to the rule of the soycuck mobs.

According to the survey, Indian men have sex less than once a week on average, and have only three sexual partners in their lifetime. Indian women have only two sexual partners – seven fewer than British, American and Australian women who jointly topped the table with nine.  Men's Health India's managing editor Bobby Varkey said many Indians do not have enough privacy to have sex as often as they might want to because the live in noisy 'joint family' homes with their parents and adult siblings. The taboo against sex outside marriage may also explain the finding.  He said sexual frustration among men could be a factor in the recent rise in sexual assaults on women, but he believes frustration is less common now than in recent years.  The survey was based on questionnaire replies from correspondents around the world between April and August this year. Indians were the third largest respondent group and revealed unexpected findings.  Despite the value Indians attach to chastity and modesty, Indian women were six times more likely to 'make love' in the back of a taxi than American women, the survey found.  It also found that 32 per cent of Indian men shave their lower body hair and that 77 per cent of women prefer them to do so.  Mr Varkey said he believed the contrast between the infrequency with which Indians have sex, and the relatively high number of Indian women 'making out' in public was again explained by the inhibiting circumstances of Indian home life.  The magazine's findings were challenged however by leading Indian women's rights campaigner Dr Ranjana Kumari of the Centre for Social Research. She said 95 per cent of Indians have arranged marriages and that 50 per cent of them are married by the time they are 18 years old.	https://incels.is/threads/indian-men-have-the-least-sex-mens-health-survey.343261/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_indian_men_have_the_least_sex_mens_health_survey.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_indian_men_have_the_least_sex_mens_health_survey.tsv	1640552811	Blackpill Indian Men Have the Least Sex: Men’s Health Survey	18	1K	0

36	1641613178	BlkPillPres	  @blackpillscience Also, you can look these stats up yourself, the majority of physical abuse done to children is done at the hands of women. Since they are the physically weaker sex they have to target a group even weaker than them, children. They also do a lot of sexual assault but for women it usually involves using foreign objects and molestation rather than penetration.  Women also initiate around 70% of domestic violence incidents, and I mean physically. Men are expected to treat women like children that 'don't know any better' and take the beating. Just because it doesn't leave a mark, doesn't mean it isn't annoying and hurts.  You see women are just as fucked up as men if not more fucked up, but it's nature's cruel joke that they are so weak that when they 'act out their urges' it leaves less evidence or it doesn't 'leave a mark'.  All these stories of female teachers fucking young male students isn't something new, once again their urges result in little to or no evidence/harm so they can get away with it, on top of that society gives them a pass and says 'the boy is lucky'.

0	1627579598	DepravedAndDeprived	Go to any forum aimed at female humanoids, and you'll find that they talk remarkably often about rape, sexual assault and such topics. It's probably among the most common topics, on par with feminism, trannies, abortion, and vaginal discharge.  Why might that be?  Upon taking a closer look, more patterns emerge. Foids are extremely open about their experiences with sexual assault and about their abusive boyfriends. Many responses from other foids are basically just one-ups, in which they share their more extreme story. Mutual sympathy always appears to be superficial, and no woman ever seems to follow up on their stories, in that it never develops into an empathetic conversation. it's almost as if their job is done once they've made their announcement that they've been raped.  What's up with that? The answer is simple. To the foid, rape is a status symbol. It is a sign that they are so attractive that men literally cannot get their hands off them. By sharing their rape story, they announce their value. A foid telling they've been raped or assaulted is like a silverback beating their chest; it is an attempt to establish dominance in the social ladder.  Ever wondered why #MeToo got so fucking successful? Hopefully it doesn't even need an explanation by this point.  Take note: Whether they actually got raped is irrelevant. On the contrary, the more undesirable a foid, the more they go overboard with their attempts at climbing the ladder. Ever noticed that the excessively vocal women (the ones which make the news with their rape story) tend to be uggos and fatties? Yeah, now you know why.  Women want to be raped. Just look at how they dress, they are pretty much begging to be raped. (Chad only though, teehee!) Studies have shown that rape is the most common sexual fantasy among foids. A significant portion of foids have reported experiencing an organism during their rape --- in fact, a woman is statistically more likely to orgasm from rape than from sex with her husband. JFL.  Not convinced yet? Consider the following. Studies have shown that White foids are raped significantly more often than negro foids. The cause of this is obvious, but this is beyond the point. Assuming that a reduction in rape is considered desirable, one would expect this discrepancy to be treated in the same way as say the 'pay gap'. Yet you will seldom hear foids acknowledge this gap, let alone hear White foids indicate that they want the gap to be closed. That's because they don't. Deep down, they consider it a victory, a clear symbol of their desirability. In fact, if you do Jewgle it, you'll find much mental gymnastics by sheboons on why their rape numbers are actually higher. It's sad honestly. I almost feel bad for them.	https://incels.is/threads/being-raped-is-a-status-symbol-for-foids.309341/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/theory_being_raped_is_a_status_symbol_for_foids.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/theory_being_raped_is_a_status_symbol_for_foids.tsv	1627579598	Theory Being raped is a status symbol for foids	53	3K	0

Anyway, this is worth a read:    Things many men envy about women: - Being allowed to interact with children without being seen as a likely predator. - Being able to have friends of the opposite sex without having it assumed you want to have sex with them. - Being able to break down and cry when you feel overwhelmed without being thought of as weak. - Being able to sit on a bench at a park anywhere near a playground without having your motives for being there questioned. - Being taken seriously when trying to file a sexual harassment complaint. - Not being the one carted off to jail when you're the victim of a domestic disturbance. - Being allowed to express physical or emotional pain without being called weak or a sissy. - Having access to the same level of resources when it comes to being the victim of sexual assault, domestic abuse, and similar issues. - Not dealing with the double standards like being told that we can't possibly understand what life is like for women because we're not women, but having those same women acting like authorities on what life is like for men even though they're not men. - Not dealing with the double standard of being accused of 'mansplaining' (even if we actually are the authority on the subject in the conversation and we're being respectful)... but when women take the exact same attitude that defines 'mansplaining', it's referred to as 'educating'. - Not being talked down to if you have the kid(s) with you while running errands with things like 'It looks like daddy is babysitting today'. ('No. I'm actually the one raising the kids as a stay-at-home dad. I'm not the babysitter, I'm their primary caregiver.') Basically, being given credit for being able to be a capable parent who can raise and nurture a child. - Women are considered the safer parent for children but are statistically significantly more likely to abuse, neglect, or kill their child. - Having people not question out of context statistics. For example: the $0.75 on the dollar earnings (often started as being for the same work) not only doesn't make economic sense, but multiple economists say that it's an average and in context the gap is much smaller when you take into account the differences in life and career choices between men and women. (E.g., more women become nurses, which is a lower paying field than being doctors as men are pushed toward. Even between male and female doctors, males are pushed toward higher paying specializations.) - Men are inherently accused as being more aggressive, but studies have shown that's just physical aggression. When social, emotional, and physical aggression are all accounted for... females are actually statistically significantly more aggressive (by about 1/3 as much). - Women don't face the same stigmas a men when it comes to things like seeking therapy for psychological issues or even seeking out emotional support. This is one of the primary reasons male suicide rates are four times that of women. - If a man wants to fight for custody of his kid(s), he's only going to win about 1 in every 6 cases at best. And that is only if he can show decisively that the mother is unfit to care for the children. In essence, from the start he's effectively having to appeal a judgement that's already set against him as a capable parent. - Having a lower chance of being assaulted by strangers - Having a lower chance of being murdered in general (strangers or associates) - Having a lower chance of dying in a workplace accident - Having a longer average lifespan - Having a lower chance of being sexually assaulted in general (especially if you consider prison statistics) - Being able to tell someone their kid is cute and not get put on a registry. - Being able to be in physical pain without people saying 'man up' or 'walk it off' - Having a much higher likelihood of winning court cases in general (not just family courts) - Not being called a virgin or an incel because you disagree with the opposite gender - Being able to find a partner much easier - Being less likely to commit suicide - Being less likely to die in a car accident/on the road - Having a lower chance of being homeless - Having a higher chance of being in university - Having a higher chance of having an available shelter - Having a higher chance of being a millionaire (at ages 18-44)  None of this, by the way, is any attempt on my part to minimize women's issues or say men have it worse. Only to recognize that 'privilege' is a very subjective concept and that men don't have things nearly as good as the dominant social narratives assert.   References:  Some of these things should be pretty obvious and not need a reference (e.g. women have longer lifespan than men, I don't need to prove that, it's a commonly accepted fact that women's average lifespan is a few years longer than men's generally speaking, in most countries. Or that girls get better marks than boys in school testing currently, look up top 100 schools in Australia and see how many are all girls compared to all boys or co-ed schools). Some of these things don't have studies (e.g. more likely to be called virgin/incel because you disagree with opposite gender), so I can't reference them, but I thought they'd be agreeable to most people regardless. Or anecdotal findings (which aren't empirical but may be shared amongst many e.g. I've been turned down from a job before because they were looking for or preferred a female, and while they didn't say that, that's actually just sexism). Also, some of these are similar so I'll lump some together.

But the state pays the rent and I only have to pay a bit of my benefits/welfare for all the bills including wifi.  Anyway, I finally got drunk with the dude next to my room (now two weekends ago) and we had a great laugh. I mean he got so many aspects of the blackpill.  So yeah whatever time moved on, I drank moderately through the week (I'm an alcoholic), but then he tells me he went out just this weekend past and touched a girl's hair and is accused of sexual assault! Ha ha ha. He even said to her call the police. Bring 'em on kind of thing. She didn't, of course; she was just being a foid.

Also it would change the larger attitude towards these offenses.  Also, such a narrative may embolden prospective pedophiles to endulge in such actions instead of repressing them. (not that most of them care about such stuff. They can always find another excuse for their sick activities).  Now I do not favor needless hysteria.

0	1636794240	evilguy	I know this is actually exceedingly obvious, but I felt the need to mention it to help spark some discussion about it. Soyciety actually hates you, and expects you to rope. They hope you do! Roasties hate looking (let alone even interacting) with you! Soyciety is actively trying to kill you, but they can't do it directly, so they are trying to coerce you into it. They will act all like 'Oh no! Don't off yourself, everyone will miss you! You still have life ahead of you!' until they straight up admit they want you dead.  To coerce you to kill yourself, we have prison. Prison is notorious for being a fate worse than death. Yeah, maybe if you only have to spend 2 years in hell, it will still be terrible, but at least you have life after those 2 years to potentially try to restore yourself. Oh wait, you won't be in there for only 2 years, the minimum sentence is 5 years! 5 years is already too long. By then, soyciety will already be so far ahead, and you will be so out-of-the-loop on literally everything! And 5 years is not just a long time outside, it's forever hell in prison! You will go insane before those 5 years are up and will likely never be in any condition to ever be a functioning human being again. Your mind has rotted so much, you would be better off roping, and this time, soyciety will make no attempt to stop you. And that's only 5 years!  Guess what, that's only the minimum! Prison sentences can also be 20 years, or even be a life sentence. Why do we even have a life sentence honestly? Remember how those people said 'You have so much to live for!', well they are obviously full of crap! Thanks to prison being so long and so awful, you will have nothing. If you are receiving a life sentence, there is no point in living anymore, as soyciety is actively preventing you from doing that at all! You may as well go ER in prison, as there is realistically no way to punish you any more!  'Alright, but you must actually be a criminal to get sent to prison! I am a decent enough person to where I would never stoop so low as to commit those atrocities myself, so I have nothing to fear!' Well, unfortunately, there is still a low chance you could instead be accused of a crime like sexual assault! Sexual Assault is notoriously difficult to refute in court, as that crime is actually one judges prefer to use 'guilty until proven innocent'. You may not have actually sexually assaulted (or hell, you may never have even been in the same country as) the roastie who accused you, but it doesn't matter if you cannot prove you are innocent, which is surprisingly hard to do. So naturally you will get a fate worse than death unless you bow down to the roastie's wish for you to rope!  Rape accusations at this point are now a full-on weapon the foids can use to literally kill us!  We are literally in danger! People keep telling me this is a conspiracy theory, but its not!  You better have a lot of money saved for a hitman, as you may need to help the roastie pin the target on you! Sorry you can't live life normally, roasties need a way to kill us incels!  I once tried to tell a few people about this, and they think I am crazy and need to be sent to a mental institution! Like, how is that going to help?  Not only that, but also soyciety is discriminating against us in other ways. These other ways can be considered Ragefuel, but aren't Suicidefuel enough to be mentioned in this already long thread.	https://incels.is/threads/soyciety-actually-wants-you-to-rope.332407/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/suicidefuel_soyciety_actually_wants_you_to_rope.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/suicidefuel_soyciety_actually_wants_you_to_rope.tsv	1636794240	SuicideFuel Soyciety actually wants you to rope	11	993	0

I don't think raping a stranger should be legal but so called 'spousal rape' is anti-male and anti-marriage crap.  That it's about sex and mating is also evident in the statistical distribution of which females get raped. It's overwhelmingly reproductively viable foids who get victimized, the more in 'their peak' the likelier to be a victim of that crime. There's probably an element of truth to the 'power' thing -- being dominant is enjoyable, but the feminists over-state their case because plainly little girls and post-menapausal women don't arouse the interests of rapists as much and surely the 'it's about power' argument should equally apply there?

A woman can claim sexual assault with no evidence in the west and all of society blames the man. Men are seen as 'pigs' here. Modern media jokes about men constantly and belittles them as toxic. And universities are littered with male-hatred. Men account for a big majority of suicides.  Its clear as day that men are the ones who are oppressed in the west.

Antonin Scalia's seat was left open for over a year just because Senate Republicans refused to even hold confirmation hearings for Merrick Garland, and after the election nominated Gorsuch instead. It is NOT normal for a SCOTUS seat to be vacant for over a year. After Anthony Kennedy retired, Kavanaugh's nomination took just three months, and that was with the whole media circus surrounding the allegations of sexual assault at Georgetown Prep. The nominations of Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, and Alito didn't take more than 3-4 months either.  So...no, Sen. McConnell will not wait until after the New Year to confirm Trump's nominee. And there's a good chance he will succeed.  Of course, it's not an inevitability that Trump and McConnell will prevail. Four GOP Senators will have to defect if McConnell is to fail -- and I think Senators Collins, Murkowski, and Romney might do so. And the winner of the Senate race in Arizona will take office this November 30th instead of on January 3rd next year, because it's a special election, and incumbent Martha McSally is trailing in the polls to the Democratic nominee, Mark Kelly. So I expect Senators Schumer, Durbin, and Feinstein's playbook (the latter is the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee) to be to delay Trump's nomination for as long as possible.  Jesus Christ, you'd think that these know-it-all Redditcucks would have a better memory.

Brusky was arrested for child enticement, sexual exploitation of a child and a registered sex offender photographing a minor. He is currently in the Washington County jail.  Brusky was convicted of second-degree sexual assault of a child in 2013. He was sentenced to 12 months in jail and three years of supervision.

Nice guys don’t finish last, unattractive nice guys finish last, which goes back to my main argument about eurocentric standards.   4.) can you name some of retarded policies for me please?   5.) my argument about simps placing women to a pedestal is why women are so privileged, also that’s a tu quoque fallacy, i could make the same argument and be like “incels crap on women despite wanting intimacy provided bywomen” see why that’s illogical?   6.) typically when i see men’s issues being belittled it’s because it’s in retaliation, i’m sorry but most guys do not gives two fucks about male sexual assault victims, most dudes i know bring up those issues to silence women.   7.) i’m not “good” with them, im just neutral about it, am i a fakecel for thinking not every single female is the same?   they’re chad-only because of simps, their standards are so high because they constantly have men hitting on them. this gets to their head and creates their high demands.   why am i an incel? because i’m an unattractive man who wants intimacy but can’t get it? and i know women aren’t interested in me, i came to this forum because there are other men who share the same issue as me and i thought I would fit in here. just because i don’t hate women doesn’t mean i’m bluepilled.  thats insane, women aren’t born liking white and tall guys with chiseled jawlines.  define coping, and i will not be admitting that because we’re the same thing. the fact that we don’t like fat obese women is the same reason why women don’t like short ethnics.   I don’t know what he’s referring to because I don’t know what he wants, i‘ve stated it was in general, it’s a contradiction to hate women but also want sexual/romantic encounters from them. how can you hate women if you want to do things that are very unhateful with them?	https://incels.is/threads/what-is-the-reason-you-hate-women.330722/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/what_is_the_reason_you_hate_women.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/what_is_the_reason_you_hate_women.tsv	1636231323	What is the reason you hate women?	78	1K	71
73	1636257589	Deleted member 38579	that's rich coming from the autismo spewing libtard memewords like ''eurocentric''. u see this as as a ''meaningless reason''? you are literally an incel because all women have high standards and u belittle this fact? u r legit fucking retarded.  also if u think not getting sex thanks to women standards is nothing important then u should go to r/inceltear, it's full of cucks like u that think sex is not important. YOU literally implied they are so retarded they get brainwashed by movies. yes they do. u get nothing positive by interacting with them.  if they are so good y dont u talk to them? why do u need a gatekeeped community of deplatformed virgin men to talk about inceldom then? because if u ever try 2 talk about inceldom with women all u would get is get virginshamed and get called a creep.  my point is that it doesn't matter if ur incel or not, u can still be an infiltrator, specially an r/Inceltear infiltrator, considering the atomic autistic bluepilled garbage ur spewing is literally the same thing infiltrators and inceltear retards say.  why don't you go to r/inceltear? it's full of people like you that think women aren't whores.  99,9% of this forum disagrees with you.   meanwhile most of r/inceltear would agree with u.  do u get it now?  u talk in plural when u only provided one retarded reason that i already debunked. so now u cope by saying women aren't accountable . u also imply women copy other actions rather than having the capacity to make actions by themselves without depending on others, so u pretty much imply women are retarded, based lol. that's funny when ur argument devolves into ''women good because uhhh eurocentric standards memeword i learned in libtard twitter blue checkmark account'' because they are pieces of shit. any other cope reason u put behind the actual reason is retarded or an implication that women aren't capable of being self-aware of their actions, therefore retarded. they do reward it because otherwise they wouldn't be in a relationship with them.  women in my country get retirement 5 years before men because ''muh patriarchy''. justice is biased against men, specially during divorce. women are constantly advocating to not give benefit of the doubt to men that are being ACCUSED without proof of sexual harrashment.  which is ironic considering u r behaving like a simp by defending privileged foids feminism and defending foids whore behavior. muh fallacy hurr durr wow you are so fucking retarded it's unreal. i already explained why it's not inconsistent to want sex from women and still hate foids retarded personality. u all go about fallacy and shit yet u come to assume out of your ass that men make stupid takes against feminist toilets lmao yeah, suicide rates, having to do shitty jobs, being mistreated in general unlike women that get pussy pass for everything, going to wars, victims of most deaths compared to women. but u decide to cherrypick ''male sexual assault victims'' and u claim u r not a simp lmao nah they don't, u r coping. they bring it up because feminist contantly talk about their non-issues while shitting on men, so it's inevitable for men to call out their bias. u r a braindead retarded male feminist u r not, u r biased in favour of feminism but u r too retarded to realise why u can also be an incel. fakecel or incel, you are a retard and u don't belong in a BLACKPILL forum when you say BLUEPILL feminist garbage. it's not only simps it's also the entire goverment simping and babysitting them. wether or not someone else caused their high standards is irrelevant. if foids had the slightest sense of empathy and sentience they wouldn't be selfish and leave their looksmatch rotting alone rather than laughing and belittling incels every time they can like the saddist entitled whores they are. u could look the definition urself and use ur brain and common sense.  if u can't get how coping applies in this context u r beyond retarded.  u r an INCEL simping for women feminism, defending their actions and justifying them, even justifying their whore behavior, all behind retarded theories like ''hurr they watched too many marvel movies that's why they are chad-only!!!'' comparing height to weight lol look at this retard. u r also wrong, there are SKINNY incels willing to date fat foids, but fat foids are chad-only and don't even want to date fat men no it's not, because their body and personality are a different thing.  on the other hand if an incel wants a relationship rather than sex, it's still not contradicting because they want an idealized situation where foids aren't whores and actually settle for their looksmatch, as opposed to the reality where foids only want chad.	https://incels.is/threads/what-is-the-reason-you-hate-women.330722/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/what_is_the_reason_you_hate_women.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/what_is_the_reason_you_hate_women.tsv	1636231323	What is the reason you hate women?	78	1K	73
19	1636080946	Deleted member 36776	 I somewhat disagree. There is high quality porn to take the edge off. Masturbating to HD pornography can be likened to a sex session without touch, and perhaps the lack of touch and sex smells is a little bit compensated for by the variety and good looks (rarely beautiful though) of the female talents. This is why porn is going to stay regardless of social conservatives being all  about it. Also, it's absurd to go after porn while allowing women to dress like sluts and provoke male sexual desire needlessly, quite honestly a form of sexual assault IMO.	https://incels.is/threads/what-is-the-minimum-percentage-of-men-being-incel-needed-so-that-men-start-rebelling.330226/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_what_is_the_minimum_percentage_of_men_being_incel_needed_so_that_men_start_rebelling.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_what_is_the_minimum_percentage_of_men_being_incel_needed_so_that_men_start_rebelling.tsv	1636062858	Serious What is the minimum percentage of men being incel needed so that men start rebelling?	31	734	19

Late Wednesday, a woman was approached by a man on a train who attempted to touch her several times. Despite the woman's attempts to stop the man from inappropriately touching her, he ultimately took off her clothes and raped her, officials said.  “I’m appalled by those who did nothing to help this woman,” Bernhardt told the newspaper. “Anybody that was on that train has to look in the mirror and ask why they didn’t intervene or why they didn’t do something.”  Officials have identified the suspect as 35-year-old Fiston Ngoy, who faces multiple charges, including aggravated indecent assault without consent, rape and sexual assault, the newspaper noted, citing court documents. Officials said he is homeless, currently being held in jail and, as of Sunday afternoon, did not have a lawyer representing him.	https://incels.is/threads/man-rapes-woman-on-train-and-the-other-passengers-did-not-intervene-or-stop-it.325840/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/man_rapes_woman_on_train_and_the_other_passengers_did_not_intervene_or_stop_it.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/man_rapes_woman_on_train_and_the_other_passengers_did_not_intervene_or_stop_it.tsv	1634581368	Man rapes woman on train, and the other passengers did not intervene or stop it	61	3K	0

Only up to 15% of black people in America are unemployed, sometimes less than 10%, compared to 85% of autists who graduated college being unemployed past college, compared to 4.5% of the general population. Some studies show 50-75% of autistic people are unemployed or underemployed.  [Autistic girls are significantly more likely to be molested in their childhood](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/girls-autism-high-risk-sexual-abuse-large-study-says/).  According to [Victimization and Perpetration Experiences of Adults With Autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5980973/):  'Studies of adults with ASC have largely focused exclusively on sexual victimization. In a college sample, students with ASC were twice as likely to report unwanted sexual contact compared to students without ASC ([10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5980973/#B10)). In an online survey, 70% of adults with ASC reported experiencing some form of sexual victimization after age 14 and into adulthood, compared to 45% of those without ASC ([5](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5980973/#B5)). Authors have suggested that increased risks of bullying, physical, and emotional abuse may also be present in adults with ASC due to heightened social vulnerability.'  'Participants with ASC reported experiencing, as children, more overall victimization; specifically, more property crime, maltreatment, teasing/emotional bullying, and sexual assault by peers, compared to participants without ASC. Participants with ASC also reported experiencing more teasing/emotional bullying in adulthood and greater sexual contact victimization'  90.9% of autistic children were robbed in their childhood compared to 47.6% of NT children and 57.8% were physically abused compared to 26.2% of NT children. In adulthood, 40% of autistic adults have been physically abused compared to 28.6% of NT adults. They're also significantly more likely to be bullied in adulthood. They also are significantly more likely to have been raped or sexually assaulted in adulthood.  [17% of autistic children were reported to child abuse hotlines compared to 7.4% of NT children. Child protection professionals only investigated 62% of the autistic children's caregivers compared to investigating 92% of NT children's caregivers.](https://www.spectrumnews.org/features/deep-dive/how-abuse-mars-the-lives-of-autistic-people/)  Autistic people are significantly less likely to be hired for a job.  [Only one-third of autistic high school graduates enter college](https://www.statepress.com/article/2017/11/spcampus-low-retention-of-college-students-with-autism), [compared to 50% of black people and two-thirds of white people](https://www.bls.gov/opub/ted/2020/66-point-2-percent-of-2019-high-school-graduates-enrolled-in-college-in-october-2019.htm). Less than 20 percent of college students with autism had graduated or were even on track to graduate five years after high school. The number goes up to 39 percent after the students are seven years out of high school. [51.5% of black and latino students in college graduate within 6 years, compared to 69.6% of white students.](https://edtrust.org/resource/graduation-rates-dont-tell-the-full-story-racial-gaps-in-college-success-are-larger-than-we-think/) [Other studies show only 38% of black students graduate within 6 years.](https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/04/26/college-completion-rates-vary-race-and-ethnicity-report-finds)   70% of autistic kids put in mainstream classes in school get bullied, and autistic kids in general are significantly more likely to be bullied.  Autistic people have a significantly lower life expectancy than people of any race, including black people. This can be due to a high suicide rate, medications they take, accidents, and some even having epillepsy.  The vast majority of autistic people have other co-morbid mental disorders.  35% of autistic people who finish high school don't join workforce or go to postsecondary education, 9 percentage points higher than those with severe mental disabilities. While 59 percent were neither working or continuing their education during the first year after their graduation, that figure dropped to 11 percent in years four through seven. However, this doesn't stop that the vast majority of autistic adults who finish college are unemployed past college and not that many finish college.  Autistic people are significantly more likely to suffer depression and suicide.  According to the study [Victimization and Perpetration Experiences of Adults With Autism](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5980973/):  'Participants with ASC reported experiencing, as children, more overall victimization; specifically, more property crime, maltreatment, teasing/emotional bullying, and sexual assault by peers, compared to participants without ASC. Participants with ASC also reported experiencing more teasing/emotional bullying in adulthood and greater sexual contact victimization. No significant differences were found between groups on perpetration. Sociocommunicative ability and emotion regulation deficits did not explain the heightened risk for victimization. Individuals with ASC have an increased vulnerability to violence victimization, which speaks to the need for interventions, and proactive prevention strategies.'  [People with autism are 4x more likely AND most likely to be victims of disability hate crime.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/autism-disability-hate-crime-figures-most-likely-a7725006.html)  A small-sample study of Americans and Canadians found that adults with autism face a greater risk of sexual victimization than their peers. Autistic respondents were more than twice as likely to say they had been the victim of [rape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape) and over three times as likely to report unwanted sexual contact.  [Autistic people more likely to be homeless, comprising 12.3% of a sample of 106 homeless people compared to 2% of the general population.](https://theconversation.com/autistic-people-at-greater-risk-of-becoming-homeless-new-research-97227) 40% of the homeless population is black, but autists comprise like 2% of the population whereas black people comprise 12.1-13% of the population. 12.3/1.8=6 whereas 40/12 or 13=3.  This means autists might be more likely to be unemployed than black people perhaps!  [56% of autistic kids live in low-income households compared to 42% of kids WITHOUT special healthcare needs. One third of autistic kids live in poverty. Only 62% of autistic kids are in very good or excellent health, compared to 72% of kids with OTHER special healthcare needs. 80% of black families with autistic kids, 75% of hispanic families with autistic kids, and 59% of white families with autistic kids experience material hardship such as difficulty affording food or healthcare, compared to 28% of households WITHOUT children who have special healthcare.](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/more-than-half-of-autistic-children-in-united-states-live-in-poverty/)  ['Over half of children with autism live in low-income households (household income below 200% of the federal poverty level, or FPL, with an income of $48,500 four a family of four) and 30% live in very low-income households (household income below 100% of the FPL, $24,250 for a family of four).'](https://drexel.edu/now/archive/2020/June/National-Autism-Indicators-Report-2020/)  Autistic people also struggle socially with making friends and finding dating partners or sexual partners, which black people won't struggle with nearly as much.

0	1626170322	BlkPillPres	The truth is women are like the slave that gets to choose its master, but they can never choose to not serve a master  So long as women are fucking 'most men' or 'most men' BELIEVE that sex is a possibility for them at some point in the future if they do X Y Z, the male collective will remain 'civil' and men will court women 'consensually'  Now imagine if starting tomorrow every woman on the planet completely lost their libido and couldn't even be remotely aroused, not even by Chad, and they were also now disgusted by men and had no attraction to any man whatsoever  How long do you think its going to be before men start committing widespread acts of sexual assault and rape? (I'd give it a few months)   All these guys talking shit about 'I could never hurt a woman' and 'I'm a feminist' would be given the reality check of the century, because they'd realize they were only making those statements from an 'abundance mindset', because they were operating under the percieved implication that 'I can maybe get laid one day' or 'I will get laid soon, I often do' (well that one is the case for attractive men)  Society can control men and keep them docile and complacent, only because each man BELIEVES he has a chance at various things (leisure, wealth, sex, etc), and sex is a very big one on that list, i'd argue its at the top really  Controlling sex as a resource is a requirement for controlling males as a resource, men will for the most part go along with the status quo of any system in society so long as they BELIEVE that they 'have a chance' to have their needs met  The moment it becomes a concrete fact of 'I will never have sex again' all bets are off, and pretty much every man who was deluding himself will have to face the reality of being a man. They will have to face the reality of having a strong and endless yearning with no means to properly satisfy it  First men will turn to porn, but ironically a lot of porn these days is pretty rapey lol, and soon the porn will get old and men will want to start doing whats in the porn rather than jerking off all the time  All the guys who told themselves that they could never rape will sooner or later join the fray, it won't take but 6 to 9 months before rape and sexual assault becomes a normal thing, and I'd give it 5 years before women are relegated to being a full on commodity  The facade of society would fall apart, and yes, just from sex alone, people underestimate how important sex is to the males of this species   The point I'm getting at is, women have the ILLUSION of choice. They can choose which master they serve (choose to fuck some men) but they can never choose not to serve any master (a majority of men must be getting laid for civility among males to persist)  If we ever woke up in a world where the majority of women refused to have sex with the majority of men, all these 'civility games' wouldn't last, men would stop adhering to the social contract of 'consensual courtship'  The male libido is a very dangerous and powerful thing, and men today aren't faced with that reality because we have all of these 'safe guards' and outlets (like laws, policing, prostitution, porn, etc), the #1 safeguard being hardwired into women, that they at least want to fuck SOME men (so the scenario I proposed will never happen)  The truth is, men don't really KNOW THEMSELVES anymore, not like we did in the past when we had to murder, rape, fight and kill, every single day because it was just part of life. This is why every guy thinks of himself as INCAPABLE of doing these things, but the honest truth is it wouldn't take much  All it would take is a little bit of yearning combined with the realization that 'there is no possibility I will ever have sex again' and men will snap, and you can apply that to anything, sex, food, money, etc. As the yearning/need builds and builds over months, many men will revert into their TRUE SELVES, human nature will be laid bare  We are all mostly civil because we all BELIEVE in 'the system' to some extent, and 'the system' is telling us that it is AT LEAST POSSIBLE that we will get the things in life that we are pursuing   When I think about it, I guess this is how incel mass shootings happen. Its when an incel comes to the conclusion that the most important things to him that he wants in life, will forever be out of his reach, and he just snaps and decides there's no point in living  For those of us who are still playing the game of civility, were only doing so because we all have things we value that we BELIEVE we will get one day  For men like me its my wealthmaxxed life of escortcelling, for others it may be a simple NEET life of entertainment, gaming and porn, for another group its STEMmaxxing and ascending, for some pajeet its that arranged marriage his parents promised him, etc, etc, etc  Even as incels, we all have these things that we BELIEVE were close to achieving or will continue to receive (because were already getting it), and that's why we haven't gone ER yet. Its not because any of us 'would never do something like that', its because we are looking at things with an 'abundance mindset'. We perceive a 'natural order' and see ourselves as being recipients in it, if that illusion gets completely shattered we will break.	https://incels.is/threads/women-can-choose-their-master-but-they-cant-choose-not-to-serve-women-will-forever-be-at-the-mercy-of-men.306216/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_women_can_choose_their_master_but_they_cant_choose_not_to_serve_women_will_forever_be_at_t.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_women_can_choose_their_master_but_they_cant_choose_not_to_serve_women_will_forever_be_at_t.tsv	1626170322	Blackpill Women Can Choose Their Master, But They Can't Choose Not To Serve (Women Will Forever Be At The Mercy Of Men)	16	2K	0
4	1627073895	SoloAlex	Ok. I did read. For me, this thread is kinda mgtow stuff because you overestimate men skills in terms of power, motivation, ….., which mgtow fellows always do too. Here’s an example: I disagree. There are many studies that show that women can handle loneliness better than men. According to your no-libido-women situation, I don’t think there would be a widespread act of sexual assault. It would rather lead to more men committing suicide than raping women. I agree that the male sex drive and sexual frustration is very strong but modern civilization has made men weak and turned them to simps.

People in general are only as good as the world allows them to be, we've all been socialized to think a certain way, but all that goes out the window when the world stops operating based on social norms  Every person would would say to themselves - 'I would never murder someone', but lets see if there's some kind of famine and your starving child is near death, watch how quickly people will start killing eachother to get food for their children and themselves  What you are falsely doing, is pretending that society is 'real life', none of what were doing right now is 'real', its all social constructs  Having a 'job', paying 'bills', going out on a 'date', none of those things are 'real', they only exist within a society and they only function within a society that is stable and hasn't collapsed  If the same scarcity I applied to food above is applied to sex, then many men will revert back to their 'base instincts' and begin committing acts of sexual assault and violence  My argument has nothing to do with 'motivation', it has to do with yearning and craving, if most men's needs aren't met, and most men don't have the belief that they will have their needs met, then these men will act out violently  I really find it weird that you would even say what you just said, I mean inceldom is still at the 'microcosm stage' and we already have men going out and doing mass murder attacks , and hypergamy and its effects on men's sex lives hasn't even reached anywhere near its peak, its only going to get worse  The only reason I never go into detail about what I think is going to happen, is because I don't want to give any FBIcels any hints so that they can prepare, this site is where study and analyze our thoughts and behaviors  Its going to be a few years before what I think will happen even happens	https://incels.is/threads/women-can-choose-their-master-but-they-cant-choose-not-to-serve-women-will-forever-be-at-the-mercy-of-men.306216/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_women_can_choose_their_master_but_they_cant_choose_not_to_serve_women_will_forever_be_at_t.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_women_can_choose_their_master_but_they_cant_choose_not_to_serve_women_will_forever_be_at_t.tsv	1626170322	Blackpill Women Can Choose Their Master, But They Can't Choose Not To Serve (Women Will Forever Be At The Mercy Of Men)	16	2K	5

In May 2017, the mother of a teen, 14 at the time, interviewed with investigators after the girl was reported as a runaway, according to court records.  The mother told investigators that she previously caught the teen talking to Jose Hinojosa, Jr., age 32 at the time, on her tablet.  When the mother asked Hinojosa if he knew how old the girl was, he said yes, but he did not care how old she was. Hinojosa also told the mother he was 23.  When the teen interviewed with investigators, she said Hinojosa added her as a friend on Facebook because he was dating her friend at the time, according to court records. The girl’s friend was 15 at the time.  The mother said Hinojosa began sending messages to the teen over several months, according to court records. Court records said the teen also sent “pictures of her private parts.”  Eventually, this led the teen to reach Hinojosa from her neighbor’s phone and told him, “yeah you can come get me.”  The Texas Rangers were able to track down Hinojosa to a home in Ralls.  The teen said during the interview with investigators that she did have sex with Hinojosa. Although she started as a willing participant, she said when she told Hinojosa to stop, he did not.	https://incels.is/threads/32-year-old-man-caught-having-sex-with-14-year-old-friend-of-his-15-year-old-girlfriend.318008/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/32_year_old_man_caught_having_sex_with_14_year_old_friend_of_his_15_year_old_girlfriend.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/32_year_old_man_caught_having_sex_with_14_year_old_friend_of_his_15_year_old_girlfriend.tsv	1631250362	32 year old Man caught having sex with 14-year-old friend of his 15-year-old girlfriend	49	3K	0

25	1631196661	Delusion	The courts disdain towards the ugly, “perversing” the law to sway the maidens hand, tilting the scale towards his guilt, on trial not for the heinous crimes he had committed, rather under the veil of justice-the lady who is blind- he stands accused for no other reason than because he was not born comely. Condemning him to the cells of Gehenna where he will never again experience a day in the light, or if the jury is merciful, and the the judge is kind, the damned will be outright sentenced to the grave, either of which is a boon to the greater good, for sparing the eyes of the comely from having to bleed.  But still, in this case I cannot understand your aversion his sentencing. Yes, vengeance should not be intertwined with justice, just as the wails of the victims kin should not distort the outcome of the ongoing trial, nor the gravity of the punishment after sentencing. But there are petty crimes and there are heinous crimes, sending a common thief to the noose is just as idiotic as allowing a murderer whose guilt is proven beyond doubt a chance of reprieve. True, the bases of the sexual assault in this case is built on flimsy material, evident with the prying, the foundation started to shake. But his actions in the reaping of another life - that is a deed engraved in stone.  You defending him so feverishly honestly perplexes me, I don’t understand if it’s your sense of communion with ugly, or it’s your vitriol towards the governing body that dictate your nation.

0	1598113850	Indari	I did not even make it through a single semester of uni yet I got the faintest glimpse of what could have been had I been a normalfag. Going to live on campus of a large university is the most magical time in normie's lives that they look back on fondly for the rest of their life. It's the first time they experience independence, college parties, and s*x with a revolving door of horny teens. During orientation, while normalfags thought about all the stacies they would be fucking and powerful connections they'd be making, I was experiencing intense suicidal thoughts that had started years previously from sophomore year of high school. When this forum was created was very soon after the first semester I dropped out of uni(I remember because it was halloween) in shame and despair already having suffered a relentless barrage of realitypills, that I was not ready for this shit and the overwhelming divide between me and normiekind that I had not noticed growing wider and wider while I wasted away those miserable high school years. I posted my despair in real time. I could not do well in class, because I could not even speak. I spent hours in the library with tutors doing homework stressed to shit and still was struggling. Was pretty much fucked in my science class and would just get ignored and left behind in my lab group with two girls. In my lit class they'd assign like a whole fucking book+detailed analysis a week. The American uni system is sick. They purposefully drown you in schoolwork as a matter of tradition expecting you to BS half of it and collaborate with classmates meanwhile feeding you shitty food in the dining halls (freshman 15) and they sold you this shit experience for an exorbitant price and it works because they are actually selling you the social experience of it. eg, getting pussy.  I got visited by typical obtuse, cold, uncaring cunt police for being suicidal a month in and subsequently made fun of for it by the normalcunts next door and had an altercation with them in which I got into big trouble for as I'd already been branded as the silent socially awkward school shooter type and I live in America where guns grow out of the fucking ground and hysteria over someone potentially being violent will get you canceled as fast as sexual assault, nevermind me never touching a gun or having any access to one (no fucking friends). I ended up dropping out shortly after that with medical cause so I didn't have to pay those cunts back and coming back next semester like a retard but dropped out of that one too even faster maybe because I could not let go of the normie uni experience that I witnessed there but could never break into and never will.  At uni is where I first started skateboarding and accumulated fucking dozens of gaping wounds on my knees and elbows when I was starting out which was so shit. Even so, it was fun going downhill, especially down that one several story high parking garage I contemplated jumping from dozens of times that sloped all the way down and you would pick up incredible speed on. I also started riding bmx there and met a group of riders who were far more experienced than me utilizing the full extent of the university's incredible urban geography. At uni is where I first tried marijuana and was absolutely floored by the experience making a fool of myself several times because of it. I met a handful of friendly normalfags during my time at uni, but due to being an unrelatable incel, nothing came of the few times I hung out with any of them, but not before I got the chance to observe their interactions and conversations. Them laughing at an out of context rick and morty clip a show id never seen before. Their retelling of how they met each other the first fucking day of orientation. Their recounting of the time they went to a club with drunk people everywhere and a girl grabbed his dick but he brushed her off and watched his ex make out with an indian guy (just be curry) while smoking. The girls I sometimes ate with in the dining hall who literally took pity on me after the RA literally fucking told them to be friends with me. They talked about their social outings and their relations with guys whose dicks they sucked. The tall white normalfag who lived in my dorm who posted on 4chan yet had girls confessing their crush on him through text and him asking me how to respond. My roommate with his healthy relationship with his loving family and gf on track to get his accounting degree and work for the FBI who's probably spying on my dick right now as I type. And much more. I was there and I took it all in, and it was fucking BRUTAL.  I never had a chance. Going into uni I had barely gotten my driver's license (brutal DLpill) and didn't even have a real phone plan or experience using one. I really did not know how to do fucking anything. After all that shit I came back to my shitty ass hometown with NO urban geography, NO late nights skating/biking around campus with my nigga with dreads that introduced me to weed and his skater friends, NO teen ass everywhere, NO FUCKING NOTHING and worked and got abused at a thankless shitty (literally) construction job alongside sweaty douchebag men at a wastewater plant in the blistering fucking heat of July smelling the shit meanwhile the normies experienced all the uni life I just mentioned and more. All that I experienced at uni drove me to the depths of despair and I nearly roped in november that year. I turned to weed coping to numb the pain and psychedelic drugs for guidance, although neither actually helped then. That   @FrothySolutions thread just reminded me of everything. I may be able to cope my way to 47 and beyond, but the normalnigger uni experience will ALWAYS be missing and that's a hard fucking pill to swallow. Even if I eat 300 pork buns right now, I will never be a whole man.	https://incels.is/threads/the-unipill-is-the-brutalest-pill-there-ever-was-in-the-universe.234108/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/story_the_unipill_is_the_brutalest_pill_there_ever_was_in_the_universe.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/story_the_unipill_is_the_brutalest_pill_there_ever_was_in_the_universe.tsv	1598113850	Story The unipill is the brutalest pill there ever was in the universe	27	1K	0

9	1631751651	Deleted member 35725	On the individual level, you @  Rangercel may be correct.  Society-wide, however, religion often proves beneficial, and reduces the inceldom rates.  Think about it this way: 90% of modern Feminism exists in order to discriminate against unattractive males. If only Chads and Chadlites existed, there would possibly not be any modern Feminism. It exists, because we unattractive men exist. All the laws against rape, sexual assault, sexual harassment, sexual this, sexual that - all of these anti-sex laws exist and are heavily pushed and promoted by foids due to the existence of unattractive males. If only Chads existed, there would be no nationwide campaigns the likes of #MeToo. This is actually a vantablack, almost impossible to swallow or digest, carbon-based lifeform extirpating blackpill; Feminism exists because we, ugly men, exist. If we did not exist, there would be no Feminism, at least not in its current, 'sex-crime' hysterical form. They make those laws and those campaigns because unattractive men exist.  Herein enters religion. In the past, prior to foid liberation in the secular era, religion was able to at least curb the excesses of foids' misbehavior. When a society is governed by religious dictates, it is usually a heavily patriarchal society, which thus it holds Feminism at bay and in check. Say what you will about living in such a society, at least you don't get bombarded with TikToks day in and day out in which foids passionately entreat the world to exterminate all short men. It is only in deeply religious patriarchal societies that #MeToo cannot and will not take root. Everywhere else, law after law after law is being passed -- right as we speak -- to criminalize the very existence of ugly men. That, however, is not a state of affairs predominant or prevalent in modern highly religious societies, nor was it the norm in Occidental Civilization prior to the secular, atheist, materialist era. You used to be able to pay JB and even loli escorts for their splendid services, or bang your female slaves as concubines; today, looking at any random slut or whore the wrong way (which 'wrong way' means 'while ugly') can get you in trouble with the police and the courts. In religious societies where young marriage is the norm, you have a decent chance of ascending, even if your looks are subpar. No such luck today in the West. In short, patriarchal religion works wonders when it comes to blocking the cancer of Feminism from choking off, penetrating, and devouring its way through the healthy cells of the national or societal body.  So, while religion may be cope for the individual, it seems to act as a society's immune system against Feminism in its anti-sexual (anti unattractive male) form. Remove religion, and you get a terminal case of ideological HIV, leaving you highly susceptible to death from Feminism, as social norms change to make it possible only for Chads and Chadlites to exist. With religion, unattractive males can get married and have sex. Without religion, as we see these days, Chadsexuality is the only non-gay sexuality that is legally permissible for men to practice - if you are a heterosexual man, you must be a Chad or suppress your sexuality and disappear altogether. It is legal to be an ugly male in deeply religious societies. It's becoming increasingly illegal in the secular West. That's some food for thought, to be digested slowly.	https://incels.is/threads/religion-is-a-cope-or-why-atheism-is-the-ultimate-blackpill.316699/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/religion_is_a_cope_or_why_atheism_is_the_ultimate_blackpill.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/religion_is_a_cope_or_why_atheism_is_the_ultimate_blackpill.tsv	1630736453	Religion is a cope, or why atheism is the ultimate blackpill	21	961	9

The chants shouted by hundreds gathered outside the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity house, often known as “FIJI.”  The protests came after a rape was reported at the fraternity house on Monday, the first day of the semester.  10/11 NOW looked into the history of these kinds of cases at UNL and learned many alleged rape cases, dating back years, still remain under investigation.  According to the [UNLPD public crime log](https://scsapps.unl.edu/policereports/MainPage.aspx), 66 cases of rape, attempted rape, sodomy and sexual assault with an object have been reported in the last five years. The crime log shows just 6 of those 66 cases have been closed. Thirty-two remain open and 28 are listed as “closed - inactive.”  ADVERTISEMENT  10/11 NOW spoke on the phone with Michael Maas, the UNLPD compliance and accreditation manager, who wasn’t able to speak to specific cases or to why certain ones are listed as open. He did, however, define what the different dispositions mean. He said a case that’s listed as open is still under active investigation. A case listed as closed has been fully investigated and reached a conclusion whether that’s prosecution or not. A case listed as closed-inactive has been investigated as far is could go but all leads have been exhausted and it’s essentially a “cold case.”  10/11 NOW was in contact with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Communications team throughout Thursday regarding the open cases. The office said they were working through their own records to compare them to the public crime log to confirm the data and said they would be unable to provide an explanation for the open cases Thursday.  The University of Nebraska website does list [policies and procedures](https://police.unl.edu/documents/ASR-2020.pdf) for when a sexual assault is reported on campus. Such report, triggers a two-part investigation. One by UNLPD, which could result in criminal charges and one by the [University’s Title IX office](https://www.unl.edu/equity/title-ix) which could result in university sanctions like expulsion. 10/11 NOW does have a list of questions in to the Title IX office regarding sexual assaults on campus and expects to get answers back soon. Both offices provide the victim with an advocate and only move forward with charges or sanctions with the support of the victim.  Pat Condon, the Lancaster County Attorney’s Office said his office only gets involved if an arrest is made to determine if charges will be filed. Condon did tell 10/11 NOW he has reviewed the reports from the alleged rape at the FIJI house and confirmed no charges have been filed at this time. He also said charges typically aren’t filed unless the victim is on board with the court process.	https://incels.is/threads/frat-guy-accused-of-rape-huge-feminist-protest-formed-to-close-frat-no-means-no.314795/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/frat_guy_accused_of_rape_huge_feminist_protest_formed_to_close_frat_no_means_no.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/frat_guy_accused_of_rape_huge_feminist_protest_formed_to_close_frat_no_means_no.tsv	1630037326	"Frat guy accused of rape.

24	1624437953	RoastieBeef	He once viciously raped a woman, but the story is buried by the jews. foids mom even called police cuz food wasn't answering (Chris takes all groupies phones due to his violent raping). mom tracks phone to chris brown house, police get called there, they leave cuz brown doesn't open the gate lol, and then brown (meeks 2.0) commences the rape.    According to the lawsuit, a copy of which was reviewed by Billboard, Doe had attended a concert at 1 Oak in West Hollywood, where she was invited to attend an afterparty at a recording studio where Brown and rapper Young Lo — whose real name is Lowell Grissom Jr. — were working. When she arrived there, her phone was allegedly taken from her because Brown did not want any phones in the studio. Even when Doe wanted to leave, she claims her phone was not returned and she was then coerced into going to Brown’s house in order to retrieve her phone.  While at Brown’s house, the plaintiff claims alcohol and illicit drugs that she believed include cocaine, molly and marijuana were provided to guests. She also says Brown handed each female guest, including herself, a pill filled with white powder and instructed them to take it to have a “good time.” Doe did not take her pill and instead sought to isolate herself in hopes she would be left alone.  The plaintiff also claims she saw Brown and Grissom in possession of multiple guns in the house and was generally intimidated by the aggressive behavior in the house.  Meanwhile, according to the filing, Doe’s mother — with whom she is usually in close contact — became worried because she had not heard from her daughter and used an app to track the phone’s location to Brown’s house. Using that information, she called the police asking they go search for her daughter. The police did show up, but Brown refused to open the gate and denied them entry to his property.  The police left and the party continued, while Doe claims Grissom was “evasive” and would not return her phone. From there, things took a turn for the worse.  The plaintiff alleges that Brown, Grissom, a female guest referred to as Doe X — who is believed to be friends with Brown and Grissom and to have toured with them — and others planned to use drugs, alcohol and intimidation to “coerce and force unwilling female guests to perform sexual acts for Defendants and others.” They allegedly lured the female guests into a bedroom and then falsely imprisoned those unwilling to voluntarily engage in sexual activity by going so far as to barricade the door and then further “coerce, intimidate and sexually harass the unwilling female guests to commit sexual acts” on the defendants and others.  According to the lawsuit, many women were then brought into a room with four beds, while Brown instructed Grissom to push a couch in front of a door and turned on loud music and pornography to allegedly “cover up the sounds of any resistance” and “create a hyper-sexualized environment in the sealed bedroom.” While some women began to engage in sexual activity with Grissom and Brown, the plaintiff refused to undress and made it clear she was not interested in participating. Still, she claims she was forced to perform oral sex on Grissom and Doe X in the room and then was later raped twice by Grissom in other rooms around the property before she was allowed to leave.  Doe went to a rape treatment center and to the police, where she reported the events. According to Allred, she has participated in a criminal investigation that is still open. She is seeking general and punitive damages, according to proof at trial.  Brown, Grissom, Doe X and other unnamed defendants are accused of sexual battery, gender violence, hate violence, assault, interference with exercise of civil rights, intentional infliction of emotional distress and more.  Brown, specifically, is accused of negligence of premises liability as the owner or controller of the property.  “Jane Doe has been severely traumatized by what she was forced to suffer,” said Allred at the press conference. “She filed this lawsuit because she wants justice for herself, but she also wants to warn other young women about the potential danger to themselves if they have their phone taken away and if they go to Chris Brown’s house.”  “She does not want any other young woman to endure the violent sexual assaults that she was forced to endure in an environment of guns and drugs.”	https://incels.is/threads/stupid-whores-keep-lining-up-to-get-their-faces-punched-in-by-alpha-male-chris-brown.302234/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_stupid_whores_keep_lining_up_to_get_their_faces_punched_in_by_alpha_male_chris_brown.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_stupid_whores_keep_lining_up_to_get_their_faces_punched_in_by_alpha_male_chris_brown.tsv	1624418228	JFL Stupid whores keep lining up to get their faces punched in by alpha male Chris Brown	28	917	24

When foids are exposed to a penis they can claim they were harassed. So why am I obligated to see their bodies when I go out? When foids say that Sharia law violates their human rights they are basically saying that they are entitled to harass ugly men. This is just another reason why foids deserve no sympathy whatsoever.	https://incels.is/threads/it-doesnt-make-sense-how-foids-say-that-nobody-is-entitled-to-sex-but-yet-cry-human-rights-violation-when-women-arent-allowed-to-fuck-chad.313273/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/hypocrisy_it_doesnt_make_sense_how_foids_say_that_nobody_is_entitled_to_sex_but_yet_cry_human_rights.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/hypocrisy_it_doesnt_make_sense_how_foids_say_that_nobody_is_entitled_to_sex_but_yet_cry_human_rights.tsv	1629313713	Hypocrisy It doesnt make sense how foids say that nobody is entitled to sex, but yet cry human rights violation when women arent allowed to fuck Chad	6	543	2

46	1629242255	Wizard32	Not exactly: it's any male you could confuse for female. Sometimes that's done with crossdressing, but there are guys who still look like girls even while in male clothing, and guys who put on female clothing who are still very clearly male and won't cause any confusion.  99% of trannies IRL aren't traps for example because passing is ridiculously hard.   I don't really see this would make it 'more gay'.  It seems like you're applying two entirely difference senses of the term, like combining 'gay meaning wanting to fuck the same sex' and 'gay meaning weak and in denial about reality' and somehow thinking they stack.  Doesn't exactly work that way. That's like saying if I'm both intelligent and emit blinding light that I am 'more bright'.   Straight is used in the sense of referring to comparative sexual preference rather than exclusive sexual preference.  IE if I have 'yellow fever' I might prefer to fuck asian girls, but that doesn't mean ONLY asian girls : maybe I would fuck non-asian girls, and get off on western girls who act asian-ish by appropriating asian mannerisms/clothing/culture.  This is probably why the term 'superstraight' got invented to mean excluding of traps/trannies and being utterly 100% exclusive heterosexual which of course describes 100% of this forum membership.  If what you thought was a girl hit on you you'd probably be so blinded by horniness to look for the subtle cues to unearth a tranny, so you might not an hero in time and have to do it after.  TBH suiciding over that seems cucked as shit though. Yeah you got raped, but you shouldn't suicide just because someone gay-rapes your anus in prison so why suicide over a tranny tricking you?  Normies think like that because it would ruin their fabulous reputations as alpha-men but that's not something we ever had to begin with so we should just heal up from the trauma like we would getting assaulted by niggers and try to avoid being subjected to such sexual assaults in the future, perhaps get revenge on those who wronged us. ie why we masturbate, which is also doing sexual with a male (ourself)  if it was solely about fetishizing dicks then they'd be wanting to fuck a bunch of bara guys who showbot their dicks and not traps who hide them  so NOT always, then  and also: there's absolutely no way of being sure you were right in all cases, because obviously you wouldn't know about the cases you didn't figure out  that said, I do think passing is extremely rare and trannies pretend it's a lot more common than it is, to try and seem like they're a higher % of the population and to cope and think their aspirations will bear fruit in current century for clarification: that's not what a trap is  Bridget for example in the Guilty Gear games rejects any of the male character who hit on him out of confusion.  It's not even about the crossdressing because tomboy girls dress like guys so if a guy looked girlish then even dressing as a guy you could say that's a trap just based on the features which lead you to assume it's a tomboy. what is LOTS to you?  there are loads of threads here about guys complaining about narrow shoulders / small hands so those aren't guarantees (some girls also can have big hands and broad shoulders, but obv rare)  the adam's apple is a giveaway but keep in mind that some have that shaved down via surgery pretty sure you'd need a couple THOUSAND to get a whore of that quality tbh  It is arguably 'less gay' than wanting to fuck a masculine bara, when one uses the adjective in terms of describing a spectrum instead of dichotomy.	https://incels.is/threads/i-cant-believe-weve-reached-the-point-where-traps-are-unironically-considered-not-gay.239172/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/i_cant_believe_weve_reached_the_point_where_traps_are_unironically_considered_not_gay.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/i_cant_believe_weve_reached_the_point_where_traps_are_unironically_considered_not_gay.tsv	1599431239	I can't believe we've reached the point where traps are unironically considered not gay.	46	1K	46

77	1628306388	Deleted member 35725	There are 5, non-mutually-exclusive solutions that I can think of. These are systemic solutions, not personal ones. I won't dwell at any length about them here, it'd be better to do so in a high IQ effortpost, but these are the 5 things that can be done to mitigate and ultimately solve the problem of involuntary celibacy.  1. Abolition of democracy. This seems to be happening currently. That's great, because in a democracy, foids get to vote for child support, for constantly raising the Age of Consent, and for the rest of the Feminist program. As the West and the Anglosphere decline and their competitors, China, Russia, and the Islamic countries gain geopolitical prominence, we are going to see the cessation of democracy. Every incel everywhere should opt and root for the end of democracy. I think that many incels should therefore identify with the Neo-Reactionary movement.  2. Abolition of all sex-crime legislation introduced since 1870. Feminist rape / sexual assault / sexual harassment laws, Age of Consent laws, CP laws, child/adult prostitution laws, all, all, all of it should be eliminated and legislation returned to the sanity that was lost some 150 years ago. These laws intended to 'protect women and children' simply pathologize men for having normal heterosexual sexuality. These are all laws that throw random men in prison for attempting to ascend with foids, young or otherwise, free or otherwise, IRL or virtually. The blackpill will spread the awareness that these laws are all evil and should be abolished.  3. Restoration of patriarchy and coverture. No need to elaborate here. Men should own women like farmers own their cows. Make women property again. This will happen when the current leftist, pozzed, Progressive system collapses, to be replaced with different systems altogether. Nuff said.  4. Genetically and/or biologically engineering foids to have a higher sex drive. This is the ultimate solution. The sex-drive disparity between the two sexes is the fundamental cause of what we're witnessing. If the average foid had a libido identical to the average man, all of what we're seeing wouldn't happen. Scientists need to find a way to increase the female sex drive, through genetic engineering or through medicinal interventions or both, and make women as horny as men. This will make us all happier. Also, we should genetically/biologically engineer homosexuality away, so that everyone is straight.  5. Replacing the current sex ratio from 1:1 to 1:10. In the future, it will be possible for everyone to control all births. A policy can be implemented to ensure that there are ten foids for every man. This is another ultimate solution to the problem of involuntary celibacy, as then supply will match demand. In combination with the abolition of democracy, the restoration of patriarchy, and making women as horny as men, this will ensure that virtually no man will be an incel, as hordes of foids will be desperate for any man to fuck them, no matter what his SMV is. This will be the reverse of the current state of affairs.  Hopefully this is enough food for thought for now.	https://incels.is/threads/when-are-we-going-to-get-to-the-solution-phase-of-inceldom-and-what-are-your-solutions-loopholes-exploits.308213/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_when_are_we_going_to_get_to_the_solution_phase_of_inceldom_and_what_are_your_solutionsloopho.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_when_are_we_going_to_get_to_the_solution_phase_of_inceldom_and_what_are_your_solutionsloopho.tsv	1627121089	"Serious When Are We Going To Get To The ""Solution Phase"" Of Inceldom?

Voting power has nothing to do with it, women only have power by proxy, the only power that matters is physical power, laws don't matter if they aren't enforced through threat of physical violence (police, military, etc)  If 50% of all men in the police force and all men in the military decide that they want prostitution to be legal or they wanted rape to be legal, it would just be a civil war, but women would have no say at all  What you are doing is perpetuating this myth of 'female power', something I notice a lot of men do  There is ONLY male power, laws don't really exist, ENFORCEMENT exists  Without MEN going around forcefully killing and imprisoning citizens who don't obey the law, the law essentially doesn't exist  ITS ALL MALE POWER  So if literally 50% of all men in a country decided they wanted a law to change, it would change, women would not be able to stop it, votes would not matter, and to top it off most of the people who decide what laws get passed are men to begin with, so if 50% of those guys want the law to change its going to change	https://incels.is/threads/dating-is-just-prostitution-with-extra-steps-the-dating-model-is-used-for-courtship-because-it-provides-plausible-deniability-to-both-parties.307059/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_dating_is_just_prostitution_with_extra_steps_the_dating_model_is_used_for_courtship_becaus.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_dating_is_just_prostitution_with_extra_steps_the_dating_model_is_used_for_courtship_becaus.tsv	1626593171	"Blackpill Dating Is Just Prostitution With Extra Steps (The ""Dating Model"" Is Used For Courtship Because It Provides Plausible Deniability To Both Parties)"	15	1K	13

29	1626727634	BlkPillPres	For me its a moderate period of incarceration <= to 2 years and a minor fine, but it depends on the degree of violence of the rape  For example if the guy chloroforms the woman and she has no recollection of the rape, was not punched or beaten, was not anally penetrated, has no internal vaginal bruising, etc, and at most her genitals just feel sore. Then he should get something close to the sentence I suggested above  Now if its a case where the guy brutally rapes the woman, physically abuses her (punching, etc), does anal (will definitely cause bruising unless he's walking around with a bottle of lube), she has internal bruising (vaginal or otherwise), he goes to other extremes like using foreign objects (some cuck shit, what do you have a dick for, this shit always confuses me), etc. Then he should get the 20 years and pay a large fine  If its a husband and the 'victim' is his wife, and it wasn't violent, then I'd go with a verbal warning. There is no such thing as 'marital rape', men don't get to opt out of their traditional role in marriage as the 'provider'. If you get divorced you lose 50% of your wealth, I don't get to fuck my ex wife 'every now and then'. Women get to opt out of their traditional role in marriage whenever they see fit. Many men are stuck in sexless marriages they can't leave because they'd lose 50% of their wealth, lose their children, their home, etc   I think society should be discouraging violent rapes and deterring non-violent rapes, because then over time it starts putting the onus on women to self reflect and see that there is a difference based on how and why they were raped  If you go to a bar trying to whore around and you get 'date raped' because a guy slipped something in your drink, too bad, you should not have been out whoring around and his minor punishment will serve as a reminder that you put yourself in that position  If you get stalked and kidnapped by some 'psycho' then it really had nothing to do with you for the most part so his punishment lets you know that  There needs to be a clear distinction in society so that women can take personal responsibility and start being aware of the reality that men are predators and women are prey, and that is never going to change, especially in a society where more and more average men are sex starved and depressed   Some people don't know how bad it gets for men today and their libidos. I swore I was out walking a night (this was years ago) and passed by a female jogger and contemplated raping her. I was literally weighing the risks, thinking about an alibi, thinking about what cameras I may have passed and how the timeline of my alibi would fit, etc  (I obviously didn't do it, I knew I would fail or get caught, there were too many variables to consider)  I don't think people in society realize what is coming in the next decade, its reached a point where there are literally TOO MANY SEXLESS MALES, this has never happened in society before, these men under normal circumstances would have been killed off or died already, they would be left to suffer in some kind of purgatory and just exist to work and pay taxes and be forced to help push society forward when society abandoned them  I suspect that rates of rape and sexual assault are going to increase in countries like america at a drastic rate as we approach 2030	https://incels.is/threads/what-should-in-your-opinion-be-the-starting-point-of-a-criminal-sentence-for-a-rapist.307193/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/experiment_what_should_in_your_opinion_be_the_starting_point_of_a_criminal_sentence_for_a_rapist.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/experiment_what_should_in_your_opinion_be_the_starting_point_of_a_criminal_sentence_for_a_rapist.tsv	1626647042	Experiment What should, in your opinion, be the starting point of a criminal sentence for a rapist?	36	892	29

24	1623190799	Deleted member 27204	Normally I'd agree this isn't partisan. But Biden comes from a male feminist background and has before shown he doesn't care much about men's rights when it comes to the chance to pander to women. That they won't hear this case suggests that they don't think it's important. Of course the Selective Service System argued against making the male-only registration requirement unconstitutional. They'd probably lose their jobs if it became like that because then selective conscription as a whole would lose its relevance to a lot of the population if it applied to most people of both genders.  The Trump administration didn't do anything to stop the case in its tracks though and unlike Biden, Trump had spoken about the dangers of false accusations against young men (even if it was lip service, it's not something a politician usually does) and rescinded Obama's Dear Colleague Letter rules that had put the presumption of guilt on male college students in sexual allegations against them.  From that track record it is doubtful that the Trump administration (had Trump been re-elected) would have taken as much of a stance in petitioning for this case not to be heard as the Biden administration (which is staffed by a politician that doesn't have a good record on men's rights even compared to other politicians (he helped draft VAWA and spread hysteria about campus sexual assault after all)).  I remember the excitement around the commission's vote. Still, compared to other things like healthcare and even NSA spying allegations the Obama administration did not at all seem eager to address this issue. They only considered whether or not the male-only draft still had relevance because of that was an obvious consequence of opening up combat positions to females. But the judicial branch could have set a precedent by ruling that the male only draft is unconstitutional. The Selective Service System has repeatedly been stating it's okay to do what they do because the courts have not found what they do to be unconstitutional. A ruling by the Supreme Court that male only conscription is unconstitutional would have fully stopped any more excuses from them.  Love them or hate them, one of the good things there. Ofc when you live in a more militarily active zone where you are surrounded by potential enemies it's in your interest to have as many citizens as possible conscripted to defend your nation so there's that too.	https://incels.is/threads/poll-today-the-u-s-supreme-court-declined-to-hear-a-case-that-could-have-overturned-the-male-only-military-draft.299313/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_poll_today_the_us_supreme_court_declined_to_hear_a_case_that_could_have_overturned_the_ma.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_poll_today_the_us_supreme_court_declined_to_hear_a_case_that_could_have_overturned_the_ma.tsv	1623099874	Discussion [Poll] Today, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear a case that could have overturned the male-only military draft	41	1K	24

I haven't looked too much into Cosby's case since I never cared for the guy to begin with, but I always had my doubts about his conviction since it felt like the women whom accused him of sexual assault just wanted the limelight (their reactions after the conviction felt melodramatic -- it was embarrassing to watch on TV).  To be fair, however, I am always skeptical of sexual assault claims anyway because there were TWO accusations made at my university whilst matriculated, and both of them turned out to be bogus. Most reasonable doubts nowadays generally stand in court, however -- gotta love courts that give into gynocentrism.	https://incels.is/threads/bill-cosbys-sexual-assault-conviction-from-2018-is-overturned-by-pennslyvania-supreme-court.303823/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/lifefuel_bill_cosbys_sexual_assault_conviction_from_2018_is_overturned_by_pennslyvania_supreme_court.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/lifefuel_bill_cosbys_sexual_assault_conviction_from_2018_is_overturned_by_pennslyvania_supreme_court.tsv	1625073642	LifeFuel Bill Cosby's sexual assault conviction from 2018 is overturned by Pennslyvania Supreme Court	37	1K	31

3	1613515951	BlkPillPres	 I've actually talked about two of the things you discussed before in separate threads and I agree  1. Male rape is worse than female rape, because its an experience being forced upon a mans body that he never has and never should have experienced, whereas female rape is just a non-consensual version of something they did literally yesterday before the rape     2. I can't fault rapists that rape women, because women decide what is rape not based on the act, but who is committing the act. Attractive men get away with sexual assault and rape all the time, and it can't work like that because that's a corrupt system, you can't retroactively decide that your rape wasn't 'real rape' because the guy is attractive, just like I can't decide that a woman robbing me at gun point didn't do anything wrong because 'she's hot', its ridiculous, and women do this all the time  	https://incels.is/threads/the-diference-between-male-and-female-rxpe.278372/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/the_diference_between_male_and_female_rxpe.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/the_diference_between_male_and_female_rxpe.tsv	1613512741	"The diference between male and female ""rxpe"""	10	825	3

If you're rich enough and live in (not America), you can even buy young girls from their fathers.  False accusations have barely any power if you have the money. Plus, in the legal system, nobody believes rape accusations from prostitutes. The changes of being falsely accused are small, but after that, the legal system doesn't really care. I believe the statistic is out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, only 25 are incarcerated. With those odds, and the fact that I did NOT rape them, I'm not worried about false accusations whatsoever.	https://incels.is/threads/reminder-that-the-one-true-ascension-is-through-looks-you-wont-go-far-with-money-alone-unless-you-use-it-to-looksmax.295119/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_reminder_that_the_one_true_ascension_is_through_looks_you_wont_go_far_with_money_alone_unl.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_reminder_that_the_one_true_ascension_is_through_looks_you_wont_go_far_with_money_alone_unl.tsv	1620858425	Blackpill Reminder that the one true ascension is through LOOKS.

I have been to 50 countries now, and I can say without reservation that India is the absolute worst place for women I have ever been. I can think of no place less suitable for a single dude trip with the objective of meeting chicks than India. Perhaps some places I have not been yet, like Saudi Arabia or some AIDS infested shithole Sub-Saharan African country might be worse, but those places would be expected to be poor choices. India, however, is a much greater disappointment due to the false stereotype that exists that it is a country with many beautiful women.  Usually I think that stereotypes exist for a reason, but India is a country where the stereotypes do not match the reality in a couple of extremely important ways. [I discussed earlier how the Indian reputation for high intelligence and tech savvy is completely undeserved.](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2013/09/india-corruption-poverty-and-retardation-a-backwater-or-the-future-of-the-world/) India is a world leader in [retardation](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2015/05/a-case-study-in-singaporean-retardation-xiaxue-celebrity-blogger/) and this is important to know before you [outsource any important business there.](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2015/08/how-to-hire-a-personal-assistant/)  There also persists a myth that Indian women are beautiful, thanks perhaps to Bollywood. It is similar to what some people expect of America based on Hollywood movies where all the chicks are slim and beautiful. Unfortunately the Bollywood beautiful women myth is completely false. In fact, nothing could be farther from the truth. I was in India for two weeks and I did not see a single, truly hot Indian chick the entire time I was there. Granted, I was in Goa during the off season for the majority of my time there where there was basically no one there, much less hot chicks. However I did spend a couple days in Mumbai and walked around in the Fort district extensively, went to some fancy restaurants, and there were no chicks hot enough to be worth looking at twice. Mean while at a place like Beach Bar in Sofia, [Bulgaria](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/07/obicham-te-bulgaria/) even on a slow Tuesday night you would find at least 10-15 super hot chicks.  India is a complete [sausage fest.](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/01/deutschland-deutschland/) There is a shocking imbalance of men to women in public in India. Walking around on a Sunday afternoon in Mumbai I saw 15-20 men for every woman. It is completely common to see 50 men in a row walk down the street with nary a whiff of feminine presence. The only other places where I saw such enormous multitudes of men everywhere was on the street in Istanbul’s Beyolu neighborhood, and in Marrakesch, Morocco. In those places it is a Muslim thing, where the local small dicked dudes are so insecure they they keep all the women locked up at home, and [covered head to toe](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/03/the-burkha-disgrace/) when they let them go to the market.  In India, there are occasional females on the street but they are completely unacceptable to the typical single dude. Overweight, with acne-riddled skin from a lifetime of greasy cheap Indian food, their belly fat sticking out of their saris; the typical Indian woman is a beast. Contrast this with a street scene in [Eastern Europe](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/01/eastern-europe-now-do-you-see/) with gorgeous classy girl after girl walking down the street in high heels and hot outfits. It’s not even the same species, dudes.  Even the alleged hot chicks are not really that hot. I know a budding Bollywood starlet who is a regular star on some Indian TV show who I met in Hong Kong last year. Sure, she is relatively pretty, but like most of the Bollywood actresses she has never thought of stepping in a gym. An 8 face and a 6 body will get you work in Bollywood if you’re an Indian chick.  Don’t believe me? Check out this article entitled the [Top 100 Hottest Indian Women.](http://www.mensxp.com/special-features/today/6786-top-100-hottest-indian-women-p25.html)  Sure, some of this chicks are alright, as to expected when you pick the best 100 out of a 500-600 million, but even the hottest ones are really rather so-so in the grand scheme of things. None of these chicks would ever contend for a local beauty contest in [Russia](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/02/guest-post-eastern-europe-the-cradle-of-supermodels/), Brazil, [Bulgaria](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/01/intro-to-bulgaria/), [Latvia](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/04/the-single-dudes-guide-to-riga-latvia/), [Vietnam](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2013/04/the-single-dudes-guide-to-saigon-vietnam/), or a host of other places. And some are downright disgraceful.  Check out this [tranny](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2015/06/callhimbruce-bruce-jenner-is-not-a-woman-and-he-never-will-be/) at #4, Kareena Kapoor:  [  ](https://www.singledudetravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/4.jpg)  #6 is totally unacceptable. I wouldn’t fuck Sania Mirza with a stolen dick.  [  ](https://www.singledudetravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/6.jpg)  If you’re into skinny fat anorexics #17, Alicia Raut, should be up your alley:  [  ](https://www.singledudetravel.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/17.jpg)  Contrast this to another article entitled the [Hottest Russians](http://www.ranker.com/list/hottest-russian-models/no-rupaulogies). Statistically, one would think that India, with almost 10 times the population of Russia, would have an advantage, but there are very few Indian women that are even in the same league as an average hot Russian woman. I’d take a hot Russian office chick over a Bollywood star any day of the week.  [Here’s another article with Brazilian chicks](http://brobible.com/girls/article/50-hottest-under-radar-brazilian-bikini-models/) for your perusal (sorry dudes, only 50 this time).  I imagine an Indian guy would disagree and insist that some skinny fat hack actress is who he has only seen on TV with makeup and CGI effects is the highest standard of beauty, but as an unbiased observer I can tell you without reservation, no fucking way dudes! India is a wasteland for women. For single dudes traveling to India the only possible options are to import your own chick to India or go pick up [horny party Russians](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/02/guest-post-eastern-europe-the-cradle-of-supermodels/) on the beach in Goa during high season. Still though, it’s not really worth it, and I would much prefer [Nha Trang Vietnam](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2013/11/nha-trang-vietnam-da-da-da/), which has plenty of party Russians, plus beautiful friendly local Vietnamese girls, and also delicious food and a high availability of drugs without the [retardation everywhere](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2013/03/i-dun-unerstan-u-lah-an-expose-of-singapore-and-singaporean-retardation/) and creepiness of the Indian guys.  The Indians, despite their reputation for the Kama Sutra, Tantric sex and gods with 50 penises, are actually total prudes. They keep the sexes separated there. My guess is that all the women hang out in at home in very unsexy saris and gossip about Bollywood. They don’t really mix with the men, and therefore the men have no ability to relate normally with women outside their family. You can’t even get a massage from someone of the opposite sex in India. The women usually dress very conservatively, because any nicely dressed sexy woman is pretty much guaranteed to feel uncomfortable at best and at worst get raped.  The [sexual assaults on women in India](http://crowdvoice.org/sexual-assault-in-india) have gotten quite bad. There are regular stories of gang rape coming out of the country and every Indian woman has stories of being groped on the bus and being stared at in a creepy fashion by hordes of weird Indian dudes. The creepy Indian dude stare is something every female traveler to the country is very familiar with.  Indian guys can be quite a bunch of closeted queers. I was regularly approached by creepy Indian guys on the beach who insisted on putting their arm around me for a picture session and tried to follow me around. Indian bars deserve special mention. Every Indian bar I have been to was populated by 90%+ men, with a 1 to 1 ratio of man to whiskey bottle. After drinking for several hours, not talking to each other, and listening to music that sounds like cats fucking, the drunk Indian guys like to fight each other and approach me, put their hands all over me without permission, try to pour whiskey down my throat and act like they want to be my best friend. Before they get drunk enough to approach however, they like to stare for the first couple hours. It’s very weird and sometimes quite uncomfortable.  It is not uncommon to see Indian guys walking down the beach in bikini Speedos holding hands. Go to an Indian menswear store and I challenge you to shop for underwear that isn’t animal print bikini briefs. The Indian dudes can be quite flamboyantly closeted. Indian beaches means lots of weird Indian homo-eroticism and absolutely no chicks in bikinis unless they are foreigners. Compare and contrastthis with [Sunny Beach in Bulgaria](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/02/sunny-beach-the-cancun-of-bulgaria/) or the outrageous scene on the beaches of Brazil and you might as well be dealing with a different species on a different planet.  I’m sorry to be so harsh, but I need to be absolutely clear that India is the worst place I have ever been for the single dude traveler to meet a local girl. The [USA](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2011/01/american-girls-suck/) or [UK](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2013/01/london-is-for-wankers/) is a paradise in comparison, and regular readers know that [I have an extremely low opinion](https://www.singledudetravel.com/2015/04/american-girls-for-sale/) of the single dude prospects of those places. I do like Indians in spite of their weirdness; they are very friendly and outgoing, but single dudes need to know that the Bollywood stereotype is nothing like the reality. Perhaps northern India is better, but I cannot imagine it could be enough of an improvement to justify a single dude trip. So if you go, bring your own chick, enjoy the cheap, strong drugs, do some yoga, eat some delicious local food (but try not to overeat) and for Ganesh’s sake, try to not get raped.	https://incels.is/threads/indias-shocking-lack-of-attractive-women.239155/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/suicidefuel_indias_shocking_lack_of_attractive_women.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/suicidefuel_indias_shocking_lack_of_attractive_women.tsv	1599428613	SuicideFuel India’s Shocking Lack of Attractive Women	35	3K	0

Rape Is A Man Rebelling Against The Corruption Rampant In The 'Sexual Market' (Whether He Knows This Or Not)  Women like to (and are allowed by society to) pick and choose WHEN something is a violation or not, it can't work that way, that isn't logical and it isn't consistent, and that makes it prone to bias and in a way 'corruption' as women are the 'higher class' hoarding a scarce and valuable resource and controlling its distribution in a manner that does not allow 'upward momentum' within the social hierarchy of the sexual market (the rich get richer so to speak)  Let me put it to you in the simplest way  I can't DECIDE that someone stabbing me isn't an assault (the police will still detain and question the assailant regardless of whether I refuse to press charges)  I can't DECIDE that someone taking my belongings at gun point isn't robbery (same as above)  I can't DECIDE that someone burning my house down isn't arson (same as above)  Etc, etc, etc  IF WE APPLIED THE SAME RULES WOMEN APPLY TO ASSAULT BY MEN, TO OTHER CRIMES, EVERYBODY WOULD BE OUTRAGED AND CALL IT OUT AS A CORRUPT SYSTEM  You see a system like that is inherently corrupt and open to bias, every white person can just say every black criminal that assaults them has assaulted them, and every white criminal that has assaulted them didn't (and vice versa)  IT CREATES A RIGGED SYSTEM  YET SOCIETY LETS WOMEN DECIDE WHEN AN ACT IS RAPE/SEXUAL ASSAULT, EVEN WHEN THE SAME ACTS ARE COMMITTED BY TWO DIFFERENT MEN (VARYING IN LOOKS) ON TWO SEPARATE OCCASIONS  Here's what I mean by that: Attractive man (Chad) forces his tongue down her throat - 'he's being forceful, kinky' Average/below average man forces his tongue down her throat - 'help, I'm being raped'  IT CAN'T WORK LIKE THAT  Oh and yes I've seen shit like that happen in real life, attractive men get away with outright assault, because to women its only assault AFTER THE FACT (WHEN THEY HAVE REVIEWED YOUR LOOKS AND DECIDED WHETHER YOU GET A PASS OR NOT)  Women shouldn't be deciding AFTER THE FACT that THE SAME ACT is only now assault because they don't think the man doing it is attractive enough TO BE ALLOWED TO GET AWAY WITH IT  OH AND YES, THIS IS THE NORM AND WOMEN DO THIS SHIT EVERYDAY!  IT IS IN THAT SENSE THAT I CAN'T FAULT RAPISTS  BECAUSE IF WOMEN ARE COMPLICIT IN THAT KIND OF SYSTEM (AND THEY ARE)  THEY HAVE ALREADY ASSERTED MY ROLE/POSITION AS A RAPIST IN THEIR EYES  AS MY 'ADVANCES' WILL ALWAYS BE TREATED AS ASSAULT (BEING A LOW TIER MALE), WHEREAS I WILL ALWAYS WITNESS ATTRACTIVE MEN DO WORSE, ONLY TO BE REWARDED  YOU SEE, MY SIDE HAS ALREADY BEEN DECIDED FOR ME, I'VE ALREADY BEEN MENTALLY PLACED IN THE ROLE OF 'OFFENDER' BY WOMEN  EVERY INTERACTION BEING INTERPRETED AS AN OFFENSE, WHILE I LOOK ON AND SEE EVERY ACTUAL AFFRONT BY ATTRACTIVE MEN BE TREATED AS 'ENDEARING' OR 'CHARMING' (EVEN FUNNY)      2. Women Only Feel Violated Because They Feel They Were Not Compensated Fairly (Either By The Validation Of Said Male Being 'High Tier' Or Monetary Payment)  What is rape (to women)? - having sex with a man you don't actually want to  What is prostitution (to women)? - having sex with a man you don't actually want to for money  I find it funny how easily 'the most unspeakable act in the world' becomes completely acceptable and not traumatizing at all, the moment a woman accepts payment for it   AN AVERAGE/BELOW AVERAGE MAN HAS VAGINAL SEX WITH A PASSED OUT WOMAN AND SHE CAN'T REMEMBER A THING THE NEXT DAY (IS TOLD BY A FRIEND): #METOO #1IN4 #SURVIVOR #RAPECULTURE  'RAPE IS THE MOST EVIL AND UNSPEAKABLE ACT IN THE WORLD, IT MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH TORMENT, SHE WAS VIOLATED SO HARSHLY'  AN AVERAGE/BELOW AVERAGE MAN PAYS A WHORE/ESCORT TO USE ALL HER HOLES, DOES ANAL, MAKES HER CHOKE ON HIS DICK, CUMS ON HER FACE, ETC: #SEXWORK #SEXWORKISREALWORK, #YAAAAASSQWEEENGETDEMDOLLAS #INDEPENDENTWOMAN  'SHE'S JUST EXPRESSING HER SEXUALITY IN HER OWN WAY, STOP TRYING TO CONTROL WOMEN'S SEXUALITY, SHE'S USING WHAT MOTHER NATURE GAVE HER TO GET AHEAD IN THIS WORLD, WHY ARE WEAK MEN SO AFRAID OF FEMALE SEXUALITY' (THE IRONY)  Do you think whores aren't being fucked 'roughly'?, they are, they are handled more roughly than the average woman in a date rape who barely remembers anything, and whores do this with multiple men, day in and day out  THEY ARE VIOLATED IN THE TRUEST MOST LITERAL SENSE  NOT IN THE 'I DECIDED IT WAS VIOLATION BECAUSE THE GUY WASN'T ATTRACTIVE ENOUGH' SENSE  But for some reason, like magic, there is no 'outrage' like the woman who gets raped once in an alleyway or gets 'date raped', now ask yourself, WHY IS THAT?  Its simple really:  IN ONE CASE THE WOMAN FELT LIKE SHE WAS DULY COMPENSATED (VIA VALIDATION AND/OR MONEY)  IN THE OTHER CASE SHE FELT LIKE SHE WAS ROBBED OF SOMETHING (THAT SHE IRONICALLY WOULD HAVE GLADLY LET GET TAKEN AWAY IF THE ASSAILANT HAD A BETTER LOOKING FACE)  That's the only difference, the difference between rape and prostitution is the feeling of being compensated (be that validation from males she desires and/or money, its the lack of compensation that women see as the TRUE VIOLATION, not the act itself, AND THAT MAKES 'THE SYSTEM' CORRUPT)  IT IS IN THAT SENSE I CAN'T FAULT RAPISTS  AS THE VERY SCHEMA BY WHICH WOMEN DECIDE WHAT IS ASSAULT OR NOT, I AM BY DEFAULT IN THE 'OFFENDER CATEGORY' AND ONLY IF I GIVE PROPER MONETARY COMPENSATION DO I GET A PASS  LIKE I SAID BEFORE, MY SIDE WAS DECIDED FOR ME BY THE FEMALE COLLECTIVE AND THEIR STATUS QUO, IF I'M PUT IN THE ROLE OF MONSTER, I WILL NOT CARE FOR OR COME TO THE AID OF HUMANS, I WILL LEARN MY PLACE AND ACCEPT MY ROLE	https://incels.is/threads/why-i-cant-fault-rapists-society-lets-women-play-the-game-of-schrodingers-assault-an-act-is-only-assault-when-they-decide-criteria-looks.230957/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_why_i_cant_fault_rapists_society_lets_women_play_the_game_of_schrodingers_assault_an_act_is_.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_why_i_cant_fault_rapists_society_lets_women_play_the_game_of_schrodingers_assault_an_act_is_.tsv	1597192917	"Serious Why I Can't Fault Rapists (Society Let's Women Play The Game Of ""Schrodinger's Assault"" - An Act Is Only Assault When They Decide [Criteria = Looks])"	40	2K	0
14	1597234516	grondilu	The nature of a crime should not depend on the inherent characteristics of whoever commits it, but there are ways to make it exactly as if it would. The recent example of Chad kissing a female in a park in an unsolicited way was a good example. Any normie doing that would be jailed, but the female enjoyed it so nothing happened. Technically, it was still a sexual assault, but she just didn't want to press charges.   View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDCI_rY1WzM   The nature of a crime does not depend on the inherent characteristics of whoever commits it, but 'victims' still have the choice to complain or not, so for all intents and purposes the nature of crime does indeed depend on whoever commits it.  And it's not just about rape and sexual assault. Justice is getting more and more subjective. Tim Pool talks a lot about it these days. He calls it 'morality police'.   View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WJ3o7ZQuBqA   Like how during the lockdown Churches had to close despite a willingness to take precautionary measures, but liquor stores were allowed to open. And how the district attorneys dropped all charges against BLM rioters but a woman was arrested because she wanted to open her haircut salon. Or that Gym owner in new Jersey.  Or the BLM sign painted on the street with tax payers' money. Someone asked for a 'Blue Lives Matter' sign to be painted too, and of course it was declined. There will be a law suit.  At the end of the day, the Law is pointless if people in charge refuse to enforce it.  In a nutshell : Law texts are being increasingly treated as religious texts are : they can be interpreted and cherry picked. If there's something in them that people just don't like, people can just ignore it.  There's this great line in Gattaca, when the narrator explains that technically employment discrimination based on genetic analysis is illegal but 'nobody takes the Law seriously'. We're heading towards that. We already know that judges are more leniant towards attractive defendants :     'Justice is lost Justice is raped Justice is gone'   View: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_fKAsvJrFes	https://incels.is/threads/why-i-cant-fault-rapists-society-lets-women-play-the-game-of-schrodingers-assault-an-act-is-only-assault-when-they-decide-criteria-looks.230957/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_why_i_cant_fault_rapists_society_lets_women_play_the_game_of_schrodingers_assault_an_act_is_.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_why_i_cant_fault_rapists_society_lets_women_play_the_game_of_schrodingers_assault_an_act_is_.tsv	1597192917	"Serious Why I Can't Fault Rapists (Society Let's Women Play The Game Of ""Schrodinger's Assault"" - An Act Is Only Assault When They Decide [Criteria = Looks])"	40	2K	14

25	1613655319	Deleted member 32800	That was a car salesman named Brian Jackson, in 2005 he was reported to have posed as starter Ben Roethlisberger, despite looking nothing like Big Ben. I guess he did the same trick saying he was the backup or whatever as well. He must have at least had the height and frame to fraud as an NFL QB.   Weird thing about Big Ben was that he was accused of rape a couple of times. The foids must have been out for a payoff but it made little sense since you don't hear about that happening with white quarterbacks ( only with hyper dumb black linebackers and such ). Maybe the way he grew up or something made him adverse to just giving the foids some money quietly? And of course it could not have been ' rape ' or ' sexual assault ' since he is a 6'5' ( 1.96 M ), 240 lbs. Chad.   Yes, the backups have great jobs and don't have to risk injury either, can leave the game with brains intact without all the concussions. One that comes to mind who is also super popular and well-liked is Ryan Fitzpatrick. He has started lots too but is even more praised as a backup who can come in and perform well. He seems to have a lot of fun out there and graduated from Harvard too. He is only 6'2' ( 1.88 M ), 228 lbs. but kind of looks like a bigger Conor McGregor so would gets tons of Stacies.   Of course being a manlet my all time fav QB was Doug Flutie, listed at 5'10' ( 1.78 M ), 180 lbs., but by all accounts smaller irl.

0	1619233762	Transcended Trucel	The Myth of The 'rapey indian man' Stereotype  To preface this argument, I'm not trying to deny the existence of rape, misogyny and grotesque sexual inequality in India and the rest of South Asia. I'm not trying to invalidate the experiences of women. I'm not trying to claim all Desi men are saints. My intent is not to deny the existence gender inequality or sexual assault in India, or the sexist mentality that persists in many Indian/SA men to this day, which is a horrible issue which should be dealt with immediately.  The sole purpose of this post is to highlight how (primarily) white, but occasionally other groups of men and women stereotype SA men into being rapists, with many even claiming that a majority or a large portion of us are. You see it so many times. Some rural village in some poor part of UP has a rape case, and white men immediately jump on it to say, 'THIS is what feminism should be combatting, not sexualized video game characters', or, 'these people seem very nice, we should let them into our country' or 'Wtf is wrong with Indian men?'. Too many white men use the issue of rape in SA to dismiss issues in their own countries relating to sexual assault.  Meanwhile, these are the same people to shout '#NotAllMen' whenever feminists start protesting rapes in the West, yet they are so quick to generalize all Indian men. Huh, strange.  Anyways, getting back on topic, this whole 'rapey Indian men' stereotype is stupid. How can you generalize 2 billion people? Do you think a person from Srinagar shares the same culture and values as a guy from Tamil Nadu, or someone from Karachi has a similar culture to someone from the Northeast? No, SA has hundreds of millions of more people than the entirety of the West, if you are going to generalize all SA men then shout, '#NotAllMen' when a rape happens in the West, you're a hypocrite.  White Britishers have vilified Indians with this ['rapist' stereotype](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857#Reaction_in_Britain) to justify colonialism and the need to 'civilize' us in the past, even when no crimes were recorded. Meanwhile, [they](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Rebellion_of_1857#Death_toll_and_atrocities) were the ones who actually committed rapes. Ever since the terrible incident in 2012 concerning the Delhi rape, which I wholeheartedly condemn, Westerners have used it to generalize all Indian men as rapists again, reigniting the stereotype. Now I'm not going to talk about or debunk the myth of India being the rape capital of the world since plenty of people have done that and this subreddit is concerned with the diaspora, so I will debunk the claim that the Indian diaspora commits sexual crime and crime as a whole more than the local (white) population.  **America:**  First off, there's the USA. Now to first check out whether Indian men were really the rapey devils people always say we are, I looked at the alt-right's favorite source, [FBI crime statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-43). They don't separate SA from EA/SEA, however even assuming all rapes committed by Asian Americans are done by Indian Americans, we still are barely overrepresented. Of course this assumption is insanely stupid since it's quite obvious that other groups counted under Asian American would commit crimes as well. So, I looked deeper. [This study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237563250_The_Myth_of_Immigrant_Criminality_and_the_Paradox_of_Assimilation_Incarceration_Rates_Among_Native_and_Foreign-Born_Men) has quite a nice chart concerning Asian subgroups and incarceration rates.  &#x200B;  [Turns out Indian foreign-born immigrants commit the lowest crime, and native born immigrants are tied with Korean Americans for 2nd lowest \(almost, we're a bit above but it's very insignificant\)](https://preview.redd.it/uc8863kr7vn61.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d3b030cc85a3ddc760ecd18186d840b250c7901)  Sadly I can't find any source on Asian subgroups and rape crime, however considering Indians have one of the lowest incarceration rate of all groups in the USA combined with Asian Americans (which indians are grouped in) only being responsible for 1.7% of rape crime, with **South Asians** being 1.4% or so of the population, I'd bet that Indian Americans are extremely underrepresented in the USA in terms of rape crime.  **UK:**  Indians in the UK score lower on doing crime than [any other](https://www.ethnicity-facts-figures.service.gov.uk/crime-justice-and-the-law/policing/number-of-arrests/latest#by-ethnicity) group other than British people of Chinese descent. Hence, we can assume that there is less rape crime committed by them as well.  **NZ:**  This is particularly significant since I remember there was this post in r/newzealand filled with racist vitriol towards Indians calling all Indian immigrants rapists. Now is this true? Do Indian men rape more than White men?  Nope. As with the other countries with a significant Indian diaspora, Indians are once again underrepresented.  &#x200B;    Indians are about 4.7% of the NZ population. And there's a lot of other groups that are part of that 'other', so Indians are underrepresented in NZ crime overall.  According to this guy, there's also hard evidence that Indians are underrepresented in New Zealand sexual assault crime:  &#x200B;    &#x200B;  Despite all the evidence to the contrary the stereotype persists and it effects all diaspora men. White men can be insanely overrepresented in rape and pedophilia in East and Southeast Asia, yet they are judge individually, while we are judged as a collective. It's pathetic. Despite so many people shouting that all Indian men rapists, statistics have shown that among the diaspora, we are far, far less rapey than white men.  &#x200B;  **TLDR:** Indian men less rapey than white men.	https://incels.is/threads/curries-seen-as-rapists-despite-raping-less-than-cummies-and-nigs.292073/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_curries_seen_as_rapists_despite_raping_less_than_cummies_and_nigs.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_curries_seen_as_rapists_despite_raping_less_than_cummies_and_nigs.tsv	1619233762	RageFuel Curries seen as rapists despite raping less than cummies and nigs	11	1K	0

A true relationship is love presented from both sides before, during, and after sex as well raising a family. Yet, this machine wants to only show love when she wants her vaginal penetrated and wants no future (i.e, raise a family) with the boyfriend. I feel bad for the guy in this horrendus relationship, no man should go through this and this guy is being maniuplated by this machine for no good reason.   The worst thing about this is what would happen if the boyfriend discovered that he is being used and dumps the manipulator. The foid would then in turn complain that she was 'raped' against her will by the boyfreind for months and all of her simp supporters will go after the guy ruining his life over actions caused by unhealthy sexual cravings. The boyfriend is in jail? Now what? Let's prey on another male victim. The cycle of destruction continues with no end in sight.   She cries out in pain as she strikes you.

You can tell they're the typical workplace snitch.  Anyway there's also this story:  ' TW: sexual assault  This guy who was married and kept making sexual jokes to me, I was in charge of closing the store and he would stay with me late at nights (10 PM) to 'make sure' I was safe. The only room without security cameras was the storage where we kept all the inventory, and I was the only one with keys (besides the boss who was never there), in order to open the door you needed to have the keys in, one day he followed me there and locked himself with me in the tiny dark storage room and did awful things to me.

37	1615689287	Wizard32	yes OP, I don't really understand your example but in a simpler scenario, person A could threaten to shoot you in the head if you didn't rape person B, in which case raping person B would be in self-defense against person A  If there is no third party, then if I understand your idea: if doing something surprising will confuse an attacker, can you do anything to confuse that attacker?  I think so, sure. Rape is sexual assault, a lot of things which would be assault if you did them to someone out of the blue don't qualify that way if you're using them to deter force being used against you.  You'll probably get a lot of 'reasonable force' challenges though. Like for example: if you have hand free to slide panties down, why not just use that hand to push her face away?  They'll probably say it could neve rhappen but I could see with some kind of zombie or monster girl that pushing their chin away won't work (they're too strong) but doing something involving their genitalia would work.  Before IT accuses me of being contrived: this is pretty much already known in a lot of self defense courses for women: they encourage assault on male genitalia. If a guy is trying to rape you, just grab his balls and twist, right ladies?  Well: there's valid theory there: that can be a lot more disrupting to an attacker than touching some other area. This logic would work both ways : if a woman is trying to bite you then perhaps grabbing her by the pussy would dissuade her to a greater degree than trying to push her face away from you.  There's basically a horrible double-standard in law where it's acceptable for women to commit attacks on male sex organs to dissuade assault, but where men attacking female sex organs to dissuade assault is unacceptable.  I don't understand it: why are men assumed to be stronger and thus to be some kind of gentle-grappling judo-master who can stop physical assault while coddling a female attacker like a newborn infant so as to save her from the slightest of bruises?	https://incels.is/threads/can-you-rape-in-self-defense.281117/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/can_you_rape_in_self_defense.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/can_you_rape_in_self_defense.tsv	1614717012	Can you rape in self defense?	49	3K	37

If she did have a boyfriend she was trying so hard to cuck him, aggressively flirting with like 500 other males. Yeah what she did would 100% be considered sexual assault if a male did it. I don't even think a chad would get away with what she did I have disliked some foids though. I agree I would have despised a male that acted like her though. Watching an autist pester your teacher about fucking weeaboo autism during class is hilarious. Larp If there is a foid that is too fat or ugly so that I stop even registering her as female then I won't think this, or if a foid has too masculine of a personality then I won't think this, but if a foid is feminine and my mind registers her as a female then I will 100% think this. I wasn't attracted to this foid though. I wouldn't have fucked her or anything. But I still thought of her as a girl so I treated her like one in my reactions to her.

0	1613177879	Deleted member 32877	A very common saying amongst this community is that 'sex without chad = rape'. This statement should be revitalized to 'Any kind of romantically influenced physical contact by someone who isn't chad = rape' because after my experience I can personally confirm to all of you that this isn't a false saying, it is not a cope, it is a fact.   So here is the story:  I am at a party with my only 5 friends, which are all weebs. Someone here once said that incels hang out with weebs because normies reject them, that is too true, literally the story of my high school years. One of my friends being my oneitis, and I feel like I can maybe ascend by being in a real relationship. So I sit next to her on my friends bed and go, 'Hey *name of oneitis*, you wanna date.' Tons of people blue and red pill alike all say that confidence is key to ascending so this is what i do, and she responds with a 'Sure.' So I put my arm over her shoulder.  Here is where the first major part of the insanity of this event happens. See, this foid had already been dating the 6'0 ft chad in our group for a MONTH or more, but still said yes to this advance and the ones I make later in this story, even after I made it insanely clear I would accept a no, multiple times, and even showed affection to me. One of the more recurring themes here is that this bitch is absolutely fucking insane, a pathological liar and overall giga-autist, she can go from accusing me of rape and then quoting Sam' o Nella verbatim the next day.   5 minutes after she says we're dating, without me knowing she'd already be dating I felt pretty happy. I asked her if I could touch her thighs and she goes 'I dont care'  So 6 months after this story, at lunch, I overhear her talking to her friend who is known to have stolen 200$ worth of pot from another girl, and she says that I asked her, but then she says that I 'groped' her. The fucking audacity, the sheer amount of stretch between saying yes to having your thighs touched to groping, is one that I cant comprehend. This is a serious allegation too, I could go to jail because her memory is so thin it manages to go 4 stages past the final phase of the caretaker or shes an actual fucking psychopath who wants my ass in jail for regretting having me touch her (so an average foid).  Meanwhile half an hour later she lets her hand be sucked by the 6ft chad, no consent, no asking if its ok, and that's not any thing bad at all. You know why? We all know why, but its because its chad, I didn't understand the scope of how fucking brutal I got blackpilled at that moment, but looking back, i dont have words to explain something like that.   Late in the party, Im drunk because my redneck friend's parents literally allowed us to do whatever we wanted. I ask her if she can sit on my lap and she says ok, so i semi-firmly plopped her onto my lap while i breathe heavily, which lasted for 5 seconds. I really regret doing that. even if she said yes im aware that was not normal to do, i really cant apologize at this point but yeah. It may have been 5 seconds but remember guys, 5 seconds without chad, thats the crime. She then just starts going full on to the chad like a paper clip to a 30 pound neodymium magnet which had me super fucking confused, so im like ' tf are you doing?' and she doesnt say anything. Im super confused but she leaves an hour later with her parents, not cause what happened, she just had to leave with her mom at that time.  Important point, she has daddy-issues. And you know what daddy-issues does to a foid? Makes her lose about 50% of her conscious. Im sure this contributed to why she acts in such a delusional way.   Anyways, me and the boys spend the rest of the night watching harry potter while all drunk and I start to realize how hard i lost. I lost my oneitis to chad, straight up, no other factors, stacy went to chad (5/10 but i use foid and stacy in equal matter fuck you).   I was depressed, I used to browse this site rarely because I had already been blackpilled before this, but god damn did i really just get blackpilled, in the most dictionary sense possible. I really felt the scope of how many foids only want chad.   See, I have a cope mechanism whenever something makes me sad, I make jokes about it. Don't @ me with jestermaxxing, that shit doesnt work ever, im pretty sure that term was made because it doesnt work, to anyone who thinks they're funny, it doesnt get foids, it gets friends (with males not foids).  So i made up this joke that the chad cucked me so hard that a rick sanchez funko pop appeared in my bed, and that everytime he hugged his gf another appeared in my locker.  After the party chad and stacy had been dating for 7 months, party had been over the summer.  Guess what happens when you insinuate that a stacy only likes chad? They go fucking ape shit. And when I made the funko pop joke near the stacy, she lost her fucking shit. She said that everything I did to her was without consent and that I needed to shut the fuck up. So we have lying, getting pissed over a joke, and insinuating sexual assault, which is a bit illegal at least in America. So im kind of freaking out at this moment but I assume shes just on her period and is currently just in an odd mood.   All of the group doesnt think what i did was assault, even her bf, execpt the redneck whos house i visited for the party. This dude is the most retarded person I know who doesnt have a mental disability, and the incarnate of 'Talks shit cant get hit' and thats what I did. I go 'You're a simp like IDubbz and fat as fuck, might as well call you IChubbs' And he got FUCKING MAD. The dude that publically makes an allegation against me, gets mad when i call him a semi-funny name. 3 months after i call him that and hes never gotten over it, still has grudge like a fat soy consooming weeb cunt.   So now, the big one the fucking nuke, the one that sent me over the edge.  A new girl comes to our school, and i meet her in the hallway and I ask her ' Hey are you based' (I constantly use incel lingo in public that nobody understands and its funny as shit, I can walk up to the principal and go 'Any foids acting up toady?' and he wont alert me to the FBI) When the stacy comes and goes 'DONT TALK TO *my name cause shes talking to me*'  Later I ask her, 'Hey, why did you go apeshit when I asked the new girl if sehs based?' and shes says  'Oh i went apeshit when you compared you raping me to a funko pop, dont ever talk to me again' walks off and talks to her friends and talks about sticks needles in my cock, where the friend replies with his signature disappointed 'yeah...'  Remember, rape is illegal, real or fake. She thinks I raped her. I remember ' Sex without chad = rape' OH FUCK OH FUCK OH FUCK ITS HAPPENING. She hasnt went to any authority figure cause nobody belives a thing shes says but its fucking terifying having a person think you raped them, ITS SERIOUS. AND SHE DOESNT UNDERSTANDS CAUSE SHES A RETARD FOID. Ive been accused falsely of rape, it happened its over. And the next day? She pretends nothing happened because her memory morphs into a completely different thing every 5 seconds unless its remembering what chads cock smelled like.

This brings on shame, the pathetic tone of voice these ppl use when conversing with the victim sure as shit doesn't help.  The way you view anything is shaped by those around you until you deconstruct it later in life & make up your own opinions based on belief in some higher authority or observation & how you've been affected personally.  In women the trauma is the notion of an ugly male giving them one.	https://incels.is/threads/do-people-really-believe-sexual-harassment-causes-trauma.281817/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/do_people_really_believe_sexual_harassment_causes_trauma.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/do_people_really_believe_sexual_harassment_causes_trauma.tsv	1615037376	Do people really believe sexual harassment causes trauma?	7	413	4

0	1613293311	Lebensmüder	Always a funny moment when you read the comments that cuckolds/feminists give to his arrest, they wish the typical stuff onto him like rape/murder in prison. The best thing: Most of them are liberals who oppose the death penalty, when little Tyrone/Pablo Jr. killed an old lady to finance his drug addiction they would cry for him when the judge would sentence him to death. Especially when it comes to murder and delicts with drugs/money they write those extremely apologetic and really heartbreaking letters because there they have sympathy for him, when someone wants to fry them for it they accuse that person of being bloodthirsty and vengeful, then they spit the relatives of the victims in the face when they want justice for their loved ones - they even defend serial killers with ridiculous arguments like 'He couldn't count to ten, he was a good boy deep in his heart!' among other shit. Bleeding hearts for murderers/drug dealers/other criminal scum while completely losing one's mind when a sex crime happens - a typical normalfag trait in the West.  As soon as their own subjective threshold gets crossed they turn into bloodthirsty and rabid animals that wish the worst things upon another human being. But the thing is: They are cowards. They don't want to have responsibility of condemning a man to death - even if this man is a pedophile/hebephile (the most evil thing you can be according to them). They even sent the police after Larson after he tried to commit suicide so that he could be palliatively kept alive, that sheer cynicism. So when the law and a qualified judge condemns a man to death thereby taking direct responsibility they detest it, but at the same time they fetishize prison violence/rape as a form of karmic justice thereby leaving the judgement to people like methheads, gangbangers, skinheads and drug dealers who are in an absolutely no position to judge others due to having a broken moral code themselves and being criminal scum often far worse than the offenders they look down upon, they have no authority to judge anyone, no qualifications to determine who is guilty and who is not and aren't held accountable in the same manner as qualified personnel by standards/procedures. The reason why they like 'vigilante justice': It's comfortable, because then they don't have to take responsibility and can leave the judgement to an outsider and thereby nobody in regular so(y)ciety gets his hands dirty.  We live in a so(y)ciety where murderers are seen as better than sex criminals by the general public and by the justice system. A murderer will leave prison after ~16,5 years on average, afterwards there is no registration for him, a sex criminal will forever be taken into a registry and will have no opportunity to reintegrate into so(y)ciety even when he is fully reformed. The victim of the murderer won't become alive again after these years, while a victim of a sexual offense can recover and see his/her family again. So(y)ciety thinks of sex criminals as horrendous scum while painting murderers or drug dealers as mere victims of circumstances that would have been perfect innocent angels under other circumstances while denying the struggles that many sex criminals have with their own sexuality/demons. A person who commits an act for nothing more than greed is seen as better as someone who fought with demons for his entire life (most paraphilias like pedophilia are something you are born with) and then lost the battle after years of mental decay, although with the most common definition of 'evil' (causing unnecessary suffering due to your own voilition and by your own free will) the drug dealer/murderer would be far more evil because the entire nature of the sex criminal compells him to commit his crimes which restricts his freedom of choice/will while the drug dealer/murderer most of the time does it for financial profit/gain without ever feeling that intrinsic force, these offenders have a greater variety of options but still chooses the wrong one thereby deliberately choosing 'evil'. So even with the guilt-based punishments that liberals argue for a sex criminal should receive less of a punishment due to having a limited choice of options/ability to judge from the start. So suddenly their argument for high penalties against them becomes one of deterrent effects for other potential offenders (something in the justice system that they normally oppose when it comes to all other forms of criminality). Some of them even argue against the concept of prisons/police as a whole but as soon as sex crimes come into play they literally argue for a police state.  The most cynic part comes when you see how they wish rape on sex criminals - most of them have already been abused and it didn't make them better/more sympathetic towards their later victims (jfl), they most of the time know both sides of the coin. And on one hand sexual assault is the most evil thing (even far worse than torture murders), but when it happens to men (especially prisoners who cannot defend themselves) it's suddenly very funny and a joke.  	https://incels.is/threads/nathan-larson-and-the-responses-of-normalfags-to-his-arrest.277714/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/hypocrisy_nathan_larson_and_the_responses_of_normalfags_to_his_arrest.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/hypocrisy_nathan_larson_and_the_responses_of_normalfags_to_his_arrest.tsv	1613293311	Hypocrisy Nathan Larson and the responses of normalfags to his arrest	12	1K	0

0	1611855168	Edmund_Kemper	Women are raped, or victims of domestic violence, and some men are misogynistic or are angry toward women. Bluepilled cucks think that most men who hate women are virgins who can't get laid and believe that chads/chick magnets respect women. Nope. Not at all. Very opposite actually. And many cucks think domestic abusers are scrawny nerds who cannot fight other men. Nope. Studies show that masculine men tend to commit domestic violence, not scrawny nerdy men.  Rapists are usually chick magnets  In a research paper called The Undetected Rapist by David Lisak, it revealed the following:  ''Undetected rapists' have consistently been shown to more sexually active than other men. Apart from their sexually aggressive behavior, they engage in consensual and coercive sex far more often than is typical for men of their age group. Their sexual activity tends to be an important component of their identities. Thus, rather than being a product of a greater sex drive, their increased sexual activity appears to be driven by their view that if they are not very active then they are neither 'successful' nor adequate as men.'  Now some bluepilled cuck might argue 'silly little inkwell don't you know that they only have lots of sex to be adequate as men?  ' but the thing is is that many men who try to be extremely sexually active probably won't be that sexually active, and either will remain incel or will just be moderately sexually active. i'm sure many chads have lots of sex for this reason, given the pressure to have sex among men in society. So if rapists succeed at being much more sexually active than most men, then they're clearly chick magnet chads. The rapist's reason for having so many sex partners/dating partners is irrelevant to the fact that they have that many partners.  In the book [Rape Investigation Handbook](https://books.google.com/books?id=EtdMobTttnwC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=rapists+%22sexual+dysfunction%22&source=bl&ots=ZVsXu-79ku&sig=ACfU3U3synMA4gN1R9a2gM1HhfReLWnOyA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDweuJ_ubqAhWUlnIEHeYHAaIQ6AEwCHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=rapists%20%22sexual%20dysfunction%22&f=false) by John O. Savino and Brent E. Turvey, they showed studies showing how many rapists attract women and are sexually active with many women. 'Groth (1979, p. 5) dispels the myth of the predominance of 'loner' and socially outcast rapists by explaining that 'one third of the offenders that we worked with were married and sexually active with their wives at the time of their assaults. . . . Of those offenders who were not married (that is, single, seperated, or divorced), the majority were actively involved in a variety of consenting sexual relationships with other persons at the time of their offenses.' Also, 'furthermore, Groth and Hobson (1983, p. 161), who studied 1,000 offenders over a 16-year period, found the following: 'All of the offenders we have seen were sexually active males involved in consensual relationships at the time of their offense. No one raped because he had no other outlet for his sexual needs.'  I also have read that college athletes and frat boys are significantly more likely to perpetrate rape, sexual assault, or sexual coercion. 1 in 3 college rapes is done by a college athlete. Another study showed college athletes in a uni being responsible for 19% of sexual assaults and 35% of domestic assaults despite being only about 3% of the student population. Another study showed that 54% of college athletes reported perpetrating some form of sexual coercion. Sorority girls are also more likely to be victims of rape than other college girls. Frat boys are 3x more likely or 300% more likely to rape women. Frat boys and college athletes tend to be chick magnets. I also read that college men who played aggressive sports in HS (also chads) are more likely to commit domestic violence or psychological relationship in college dating relationships, are more likely to commit sexual coercion, are more hostile toward women and more sexist and accepting of violence and believe more in rape myth acceptance.  I also read studies (that i can't remember the names of) where it revealed that rapists often lose their virginity at an early age, have their first date at an early age, have a much higher number of sex partners, and have a higher number of dating partners.  Tough guys and strong men usually commit domestic violence, not scrawny nerdy men  *Domestic violence is one of the most common crimes of professional athletes, including football players and wrestlers/fighters. look at ray rice, stone cold steve austin, floyd mayweather, greg hardy, dan wilkinson, etc.  *[Muscular men actually are more likely to be aggressive and more likely to be experienced in physical violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398605/) and [this stereotype is true](https://psmag.com/social-justice/biff-was-born-nasty-and-then-he-got-some-bicepts)  *[Men focused on being muscular are more 'misogynistic'.](https://www.livescience.com/21172-men-sexist-attitudes-muscles.html)  *A lot of the domestic abusers i saw on google images look pretty strong.  *Hypermasculinity (aka emphasis on being as manly as possible, physical strength, and emphasis on aggression) often causes physical and sexual aggression towards women.  *I read a study that men who conform to masculine stereotypes and masculine norms/traditions are more likely to beat their intimate partner. Men who don't care about being manly are less likely to beat their intimate partner.  *Domestic violence is a problem in the military (and so is sexual assault). People in the military are tough and very strong. Sexual assault/rape is also a big issue in the military.  Chick magnets are far more misogynistic, study says  In a study of 2,703 teenagers in Spain ages 14 to 20 (M=15.89; SD=1.29), including 1,350 teenage boys (M = 15.95; SD = 1.30) and 1,353 teenage girls (M = 15.83; SD = 1.28), researchers found a very strong correlation between sexism and sexual and romantic success. The study revealed that sexually active teenage boys have more benevolent sexism, more hostile sexism, and more ambivalent sexism than non-sexually active teenage boys. Additionally, benevolently sexist men had their first sex at an earlier age and hostile sexist men had a lower proportion of condom use. The study also revealed that women are attracted to benevolently sexist men. The study revealed that teenage boys without sexual experience had the least amount of hostile sexism, benevolent sexism and ambivalent sexism. Boys with non-penetrative sexual experience had more of the three types of sexism, and boys with penetrative sexual experience had the most amount of the three types of sexism. I know this only focuses on teenage boys, but honestly people in their 20s these days still act like teenagers. People don't become mature nowadays until their 30s.  Conclusion:  People think that most misogynistic men cannot get laid, are virgins or get rejected by women. Nope. Very opposite is true. Virgins who hate women are rare, they're just the type the media emphasizes. Yes we all hear about the nice guys who complain about women, or people on this forum who are incels, but virgins like us are only like 1% of virgins. We are just emphasized by social media while most sexist men are swept under the rug. The reason we don't hear about chick magnets criticizing women online is because chick magnets usually hide their misogyny and don't post too much on social media/forums because they're busy socializing IRL while virgin men are more likely to type or rant online because they might be socially withdrawn. Virgin men as a result might express their feelings online more and rant more online, which is why we hear about misogynistic virgins, even though they're a rare type of virgin. Statistics show that virgin men are less sexist and chick magnets are more sexist. i rely more on what statistics say than what the media/internet says. the media/internet always emphasizes the rare stuff while the usual stuff is swept under the rug. People often think domestic abusers beat their GF because she's vulnerable. Nope. if that was true, then why are gay men just as likely to be domestic abusers? i read that domestic abusers usually do it for many reasons, they might feel jealous toward her because she has a more successful background, they worry she is cheating or might leave him, they want to control what she does or what happens in the relationship, anger issues, etc. these are their motives. it has nothing to do with her being vulnerable.  normies and cucks like to emphasize virgin men or scrawny nerdy sub5 manlets as the perpetrators of misogyny and aggression against women because virgin men and sub5 men are easy targets for ridicule while chick magnets and big muscular men are difficult to ridicule.	https://incels.is/threads/study-most-violence-misogyny-and-hostility-toward-women-is-done-by-chads-not-virgins-yet-virgins-and-sub5-men-are-blamed-for-it-all.274247/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/venting_study_most_violence_misogyny_and_hostility_toward_women_is_done_by_chads_not_virgins_yet_vir.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/venting_study_most_violence_misogyny_and_hostility_toward_women_is_done_by_chads_not_virgins_yet_vir.tsv	1611855168	Venting [STUDY] Most violence, misogyny, and hostility toward women is done by chads, NOT virgins.

They'll always make time to go after incels because the leftist mobs are at their heart like all mainstream political mobs think women are better than men and women should be immune from criticism or lack of enthusiasm for them.  That's what people in power would want so they can spin their own narrative. Hate to say this but anyone who has so much as visited this site frequently cannot erase anything even if they lay low. If statute of limitations laws can be superseded in cases of rape and sexual assault they can also at some point for 'viewing terrorist material frequently in the past' if things get bad enough.

0	1608332351	Askiel	If you want to know what I think is causing a “disparity in the dating market,” I’d have to answer with sexism and gender roles. According to gender roles, men are supposed to be the one’s pursuing women, and women are just supposed to hope that the man they like actually ever pursues them. Furthermore, men who practice toxic masculinity (for reference, toxic masculinity isn’t the idea that all “masculine things” are bad, toxic masculinity refers specifically to the toxic behaviors that men are taught to do or not to do. Toxic masculinity includes bottling of emotions, and the encouragement/normalization of violence.) men who practice Toxic masculinity are more violent, and that violence includes sexual assault. I know a number of women who have expressed that they feel unsafe around men, or feeling unsafe being alone, And as of what I’ve actually seen, women don’t actually “date up” if I had to guess why women match with less people on tinder, it’s not just that there are literally less women on tinder (only 1/3 of tinder users are female) but also because of gender roles, and because of caution. And the reasons men do the inverse is because of well, gender roles and a lack of caution. Incels blaming women is regressive in this regard, they further sexism with their ideas, hence why it is so hard for these people to find dates.  I found this on Reddit and like to hear your views on this.	https://incels.is/threads/reason-for-dating-market-and-incel-problem-according-to-a-female-redditor.265518/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_reason_for_dating_market_and_incel_problem_according_to_a_female_redditor.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_reason_for_dating_market_and_incel_problem_according_to_a_female_redditor.tsv	1608332351	Discussion Reason for Dating Market and Incel problem according to a female redditor	43	2K	0
20	1608346344	Arthas93	 Yikes, let's unpack this: --- Number 1 So she is saying that women are choosing only Chads and ignoring 99% of the other unattractive males because of sexism (discriminating based on sex) and gender roles.  Yet she doesn't say which sexism or which gender roles she is referencing to, nor how such things make women choose only muscular 6' tall Chads only.  So she means to say that all ugly men are sexist against women, and that they follow gender roles that are repressive towards women. Therefore women don't choose them.  And because of that, women only give free raw sex to handsome muscular Chads, because the handsome muscular Chads are good. They are not sexist and don't follow gender roles.  So, in her opinion, Chads don't discriminate based on sex, nor do they follow gender roles. Therefore they are rightfully chosen for procreation. ---  Number 2 Her definition of gender roles, somehow don't seem to me like her honest view of what a 'gender role' actually is. But lets use it.  So the men that pursues the women he wants, and the women that awaits and allows the men she likes to approach her, are following gender roles. And that is one of the two problems, alongside sexism, that makes women only choose 6' tall muscular Chads.  Makes no sense to me. So when a man goes up to flirt with a woman, that turns her down, and instead of choosing him, she develops interest in the men that shows no interest in her, and who doesn't approach her.  Let's try to define those men:  'So when a muscular handsome Chad approaches a woman, that turns her down, and instead of choosing him, she develops interest in the ugly men that shows no interest in her, and who doesn't follow that gender role.' I never saw in my life a woman turning down a Chad.  'So when an ugly man approaches a woman, that turns her down, and instead of choosing him, she develops interest in the Chad that shows no interest in her, and who doesn't follow that gender role'. Seems more like it.  So ugly men approaching woman, makes woman go after only Chads. So it's the ugly men fault that the market is so unbalanced. If they only stopped taking action, and became potted plants, women would naturally chose them over Chad. Jesus Christ. ---  Number 3 Wait, what does 'toxic masculinity' has to do with it? Is it in reference to the 'sexism' she mentioned? Let's give her 'the benefit of the doubt' and take it as that. So when a man is toxic, he is sexist, and that makes women choose only tall, rich, Omega Chads.  She doesn't define what that 'toxic masculinity' is. ---  Number 4 Word salad. She doesn't define what the 'toxic behaviors' are. I have a feeling that she does that on purpose. Because if she defines what that 'toxic behavior' is, it will be the exact same behavior that 'bad boys' do. And foids are attracted to those 'bad boys' exactly because of their toxic masculinity. ---  Number 5 So she gives on example of toxic masculinity: 'bottling of emotions'. Because we all know that when men expose their inner feelings women are immediately attracted to that. Nothing arouses women sexually more than a sensible man. That explains why women today reject all sort of Big muscular handsome tough guys, and only choose the fragile, sensible, feminine beta males...  ...wait... that is not the reality we are in...  Men don't 'bottle their emotions up' because other men force that 'toxic behavior' on them. Men 'bottle their emotions up' because women give them ZERO sex if they commit the mistake of doing that. In fact, women are very quick to humiliate and emasculate any man who shows his true emotions. ---  Number 6 Oh, so these toxic males are violent. And that includes sexual assault. So let's recap: sexism (leads to/includes) toxic masculinity (leads to/includes) violence (leads to/includes) sexual assault. Got it.  So foids only give free raw sex to violent felon Tyrones condemned for sexual assault, because they dislike violent men that sexually assault. Makes total sense. ---  Number 7  Poor women. They feel unsafe around men, and they feel unsafe alone. : (  They only feel safe around other women. That is why they never leave their homes alone or accompanied by males. In fact, that explains why they never partake in sorority parties and orgies with Chads and Tyrones. They are scared of penis.  So they do the only thing they can. They stay close to each other, seeking protection in numbers. Like the wildebeest in Africa, and the zebras and buffaloes.  Because if one of them stray away from the others, even for a second, the big bad men will show up, and sexually assault and murder her.  That is why women never use Tinder or OnlyFans(tm), they are afraid of men. They don't want men to pay attention to them. They only want to ruminate and graze peacefully on the savannah. ---  Number 8 Oh yeah, women don't actually 'date up'. They rather choose men who are bellow them economically, socially and attractively.  That explains why we see so many women dating homeless men, or going to India to date curry janitors.  Also explains why women often turn down rich handsome Chads and instead choose virgin males that live with their mothers.

13	1606224049	andinocel	This reminds me of a time when I was in fourth grade. I was the quiet, awkward, weird kid that was often picked on, both by students and teacher. The teacher stepped out (prob to take a shit or do coke, IDK and IDGAF) and put two girls (her favorite pets) to watch over the class. The two bitches made up a story that I was being disruptive, I was given extra homework and the teacher sent a note to my parents. One kid spoke up and said that they were lying, they were trying to get me in trouble just for shits and giggles, but, since the female gender is a pure angelic being that never lies, the teacher ignored him. All because I was ugly and a little weird due to my aspergers (which at the time was not picked up --- everyone thought I was simply stupid) If I were school during these times, I would have definitely had some kind of fake sexual assault claim against me, like this poor kid. Even to this day, I never stay alone with a female. At work I share an office with a girl, but the door remains open at all times.  There's a reason why many civilizations in the past (ancient Rome, ancient Greece, Byzantine Empire) didn't allow women to testify. Saudi Arabia still really doesn't. Modern commentary derides this as 'evil', but they were blackpilled enough to know that a woman's word is unreliable.	https://incels.is/threads/the-power-foids-have-in-this-soyciety.260518/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_the_power_foids_have_in_this_soyciety.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_the_power_foids_have_in_this_soyciety.tsv	1606171740	RageFuel The power foids have in this soyciety	36	2K	13

What's the coincidence that every girl I would sit next to always get off the next stop or the one right after?  3. I don't know about this one because I try to not look at them as I know it might seen as sexual assault.  4. As I said in the other link, I never paid attention to that part. I will the next time I'm close to one on a bus or a train.  5. Opposite. They pull the bag to their other side like they think I might grab and steal it or something. Or they put it right to their stomach and cling onto it like they're using it as a shield or once again trying to protect it like I would grab and steal it or something.  6. This one is why I try not to sit next to them anymore.  7. Never tried looking at that one in all honesty so I don't know if this happens. It's usually either full or near to half empty. Which in those cases they can't get away from me if I'm standing next to them and if there's room, they will look for a spot that's isolated. Which I'm not going to lie, I tend to do the same on the bus and train. I look for a spot where I can't be bothered.

7	1607834128	Lebensmüder	 If you like disapperances look up Missing 411 by David Paulides for unexplainable happenings in natural parks.  Also there was a happening in my country quiet recently where an old man just suddenly started to speed up his bike and after others lost sight of him he vanished without a trace. Sadly, all channels I follow for disappearances are in my native language.  If you like unsolvable cold cases I recommend the following because they are very interesting:  Tube sock killings (person who was once considered to be the perpetrator was found dead thirty years later as a victim)  Monster Of Florence (serial killer who stalked couples, shot them and removed the genitals of the females probably for later cannibalism, he also sent body parts in letters)  Monster of Udine (serial killer who performed abdominal mutilations on his victims that vaguely resembled a ceserean)  Conneticut River Valley Killings (unknown serial killers or multiple perpetrators that liked to stab victims, most corpses were hitchhikers or random naturalists, but also one case of home invasion)  Columbia Parkway Killings (slaughtered couples, probably the work of a serial killer)  East Bound Strangler (serial killer who removed the shoes of his victims and made them all look east, could also be non-existant, because in the area where the bodies were found there was a flood that could explain the position)  And also the West Mesa Bone Collector or Long Island Serial Killer, but you probably already know about them.  Here some cold cases from my country:  The Harz Killings (unknown perpetrator stalked men in the woods and shot them with a modified gun, afterwards he would perform severe mutilations/dismemberments on the body)  The Münsterland Killings (unknown perpetrator picked up hitchhikers/prostitutes and strangled them to death, no sexual assault, probably because killer ejaculated during the kill)  The Channel Killings (unknown perpetrator who liked to pick up homeless children/teenagers, sexually abused and tortured them and then dropped them into the sewage where they drowned/were torn to shreds, likely suspect who had homosexual sex parties with minors involved identified but due to lack of evidence never charged)  The Hamburger Trümmermorde (in Hamburg after WWII nude bodies turned up that were never identified, nowadays it's speculated that an unknown perpetrator exterminated his whole family to cut costs)  The Missing Children Of Pirmasens (several children of both genders disappeared, a local man was charged, he described their abductions but his description matched his own, also many children report that he molested them, he also confessed to murdering hikers during schizophrenic episodes by pushing them off mountains, suspect got released due to lacking evidence and his confessions being worthless due to insanity, bodies never found)  Everything related to Kurt Werner Wichmann (Wichmann was an ex-sex-offender and a sadistic/arrogant psychopath with chronic monetary issues, he loved weaponry and had a house full with sadomasochistic porn, nazi memorabilia/literature, an escape tunnel, secret rooms and buried secrets (like walled in corpses, buried cars), he killed himself in prison, but left very concerning suicide notes, he is responsible for the slaying of two couples (The Göhrde Killings, probably as a contract killer) and a local woman, but his body count is estimated to be far higher and reaching the 100s)  Hope I cold spark your interest with some cold cases. I know some fine documentaries about unsolved disappearances in English, I will look them up in a few hours if you'd like, but I sadly forgot the names.

41	1606353936	TaiLung	I genuinely think that you are braindead for even asking this question. Who the fuck cares if you are 'cucked'. Do you care? Does anyone of this retarded forum care if you just dipped your dick into a whore? You should care about what makes you happy. Whether or not you give $100 to some random foid is not in anyway going to impact the world, society nor you. Its either you do it, or some other social outcast does it and why would you think that any of these women enjoy it? If you should have learned anything from this forum its that women hate ugly men with a passion. In fact there is quite possibly nothing they could possibly hate more in the world than ugly men. If you just come close to them they will usually go OUT OF THEIR WAY to get your into jail for sexual assault. So you really think they would enjoy having sex with you for $100? They do it because they have no other option. No woman in the entire world would willingly do this job. For you and me it looks like its the easiest job in the world, but from all i know from woman its probably mental torture for their brains. So to get to the point, no you are not cucked for paying a prostitute. You literally get exactly what you want in life for $100 which is literally nothing. Sure its not the same as a girlfriend but its a thousand times better than rotting until you kill yourself. Literally nobody gives a fuck what you do, you can do anything you want if it makes you happy. The only goal in life is to feel happy, nothing else matters. NOBODY cares whether or not you were cucked when you are dead. And even if they do, you most certainly will not. Do you really want to spend your life rotting in your basement just so some people on some incel forum wont remember you as being 'cucked' when you rope for like 2 days and then forget about you?

0	1603497195	PPEcel	I’ve probably attended a dozen or so of these in my life, all because an organization I'm affiliated with wants everyone to undergo them.  It started when I was a boardingschoolcel in the northeastern United States; the Owen Labrie case was playing out on national media, and my prep school didn’t want to be the next one [featured on Vanity Fair](https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/03/st-pauls-owen-labrie-rape-trial). And the cultural backdrop surrounding #MeToo and Brett Kavanaugh didn’t help. Boarding schools are huge breeding grounds for potential sexual assault cases if you didn't realize -- it's essentially a pressure cooker for teenagers who don't have parental supervision for weeks or even months on end. So the administration decided to hire a couple of lawyers whose job it was to lecture everyone, students and faculty, about consent. We’d have to attend a few of these throughout the year. Some seminars would be for everyone, but some other seminars were broken down by gender and year group.  Those seminars were simple: the message was basically “don't rape anyone” and 'don't send nudes', so on and so forth. Having absolutely no intention to rape or send nudes, I just sat through them like I would one of those platitudinous 'say no to drugs' talks.  I'm now in the U.K. and over the last few years, I've noticed a shift in how these seminars usually go. Instead of saying 'don't rape anyone', there's an increasingly large focus on being a white knight. Or, as they call it, being an 'active bystander':    It's not enough for me just to not rape anyone; apparently, I now have a moral obligation to intervene in awkward situations.  Here's what really annoys me about the 'active bystander' doctrine:  As one of the least privileged individuals I know, I have to potentially police the behaviour of more outgoing and social peers who are more privileged and influential than I. This puts me in an awkward spot. As someone who finds social settings mentally taxing, I find it more difficult than others to analyze social situations and interpret body language and behavioural cues. I have no idea if someone is experiencing an uncomfortable situation, and simply am not confident that I can react appropriately. As an ethnic, I can't help but think that everything I do or say will be racialized, and that if I proactively confront a white man (or womanfemoid) who I genuinely believe is behaving inappropriately, another bystander would be inclined to side with them given their implicit racial biases. As a subhuman, I don't believe that anyone else would reciprocate and step in if I was the one being bullied, harassed, assaulted, or abused. Nobody gives a shit about men -- especially low-SMV men. Now, to their credit, 'active bystander' training tries to address not only sexual harassment and abusive relationships, but also workplace bullying, cyberbullying, school bullying, et cetera, whether in a sexual or non-sexual context. But it's clear during the discussion phase of such training that most normies still uphold rigidly gendered worldviews -- i.e. with men as 'aggressors' and with femoids as 'victims'.  To this end, I am inclined to believe that 'active bystander' doctrine only serves the socially confident and the genetically privileged -- leaving all of us subhumans here to rot.	https://incels.is/threads/training-for-white-knights-new-anti-sexual-harassment-seminars-are-now-focusing-on-being-active-bystanders.252634/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/venting_training_for_white_knights_new_anti_sexual_harassment_seminars_are_now_focusing_on_being_act.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/venting_training_for_white_knights_new_anti_sexual_harassment_seminars_are_now_focusing_on_being_act.tsv	1603497195	Venting Training for white knights: new anti-sexual harassment seminars are now focusing on being “active bystanders”	43	885	0

After all that's who a lot (not all) of Biden's constituents are and politicians like to appeal to their constituents and prove they are 'cracking down' on bad people. And incels and people on these sites are seen as bad people especially by many mainstream liberals.  I don't know how you could argue otherwise.  I would oppose this also if Trump drew up this task force. The extra scrutiny for Biden and not Trump is that unlike Biden, Trump doesn't have a history of passing legislation like VAWA, marking himself as someone who stands up for women's rights and punishes men that treat them badly and that plays up sexual assault on college campuses on female students by male students.  Already those overreaches and eagerness to punish any males convicted of offenses to females doesn't give much assurance that there won't be overreaches and spillovers from this taskforce and initiative to try and prosecute incels for 'hateful' conduct and speech about women online.  I'm not fear mongering. It's a very real possibility. Harassment and stalking are very loosely defined terms especially with modern day liberals, most of whom see themselves as champions and protectors of women and will not hesitate to try and prosecute any males expressing any unflattering sentiments about them online if it generates enough outrage.	https://incels.is/threads/bidens-coming-war-on-incels.256320/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/its_over_bidens_coming_war_on_incels.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/its_over_bidens_coming_war_on_incels.tsv	1604777325	It's Over Biden's Coming War on Incels	119	4K	111

Very few to none and they are stereotyped as pussies who are scared of women, 'weird' around them and too dorky to even make a move and coping with studies.  The 'rapist tendency' stereotype comes more from curries in grooming gangs or low inhib curries on the subcontinent that are crude in most of their interactions because there isn't as much negative reinforcement against average looking males behaving crudely as there is in western countries.  This even can be seen in other countries by how crude the insults about others are (routinely jokes about mothers, daughters being assaulted can get made when things get heated) and how people are very brief, impolite in their interactions and don't value personal space but stand very close to others. It's just the culture that has developed in ethnic countries that causes this to occur more than in western countries where such behavior is strictly frowned upon if you aren't chad.	https://incels.is/threads/how-should-currycel-respond-when-bp-normies-ask-why-indians-have-rapist-tendencies.251528/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/how_should_currycel_respond_when_bp_normies_ask_why_indians_have_rapist_tendencies.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/how_should_currycel_respond_when_bp_normies_ask_why_indians_have_rapist_tendencies.tsv	1603130273	"How should currycel respond when BP normies ask why Indians have ""rapist tendencies""?"	12	633	8

If a woman doesn't like you she may not challenge you to a fight, but she may make a false rape/sexual assault claim.  If we look at stats, women INITIATE more acts of domestic violence than men     At the end of a fight, if you weren't present, all you see are the injuries and bruises, and that's why it seems like men are abusing women more than women abuse men, natures cruel joke against women, is making them emotional psychopaths with no self control, but also too weak to inflict much harm without resorting to extreme measures.  Child loving - Do we even need to touch this one, women don't and never have loved children, they loved the security as an asset to a household that being a child bearer and rearer provided for them, and now that they no longer need that security, children are disposable, which is why women are aborting children left and right.  Also statistically, children are abused and killed more by women than by men, especially in cases of parents killing children  Kind - Women are some of the most uncaring, sadistic, people I know, the kindest people I know are all men, women are vindictive, unreasonable, illogical, will try to put someone down and make fun of them at the slightest opportunity, and they are always speaking ill of others behind their backs, especially other women  One of my funniest memories at a work place, were the interactions I observed between female workers, there were 3 in particular, for simplification, lets call them Hole A, Hole B and Hole C  Hole A & Hole B are together - Speak ill of Hole C Hole A & Hole C are together - Speak ill of Hole B Hole B & Hole C are together - Speak ill of Hole A Hole A & Hole B & Hole C together - Speak ill of everyone else, laugh together and pretend to be the best of friends  Women are the most disgusting fucking individuals on the planet, this is why there is no such thing as a 'female friend', even for females, most of these so called 'friends' speak ill of eachother on a regular basis and work behind the scenes to negatively impact eachothers lives. Men don't do this shit, seriously what the fuck is wrong with women  Beautiful - JFL these days they don't even need to stay in shape to land themselves a Chad much less a beta provider, even landwhales demand a 6ft Chad, beauty is no longer a priority since they can work and gain resources and property for themselves, and to top it of the dating market is so skewed they can date well above their own league  Committed/Faithful - Women were always the ones who wanted to cheat most, there were just restrictions on them, now without those restrictions, female infidelity is through the roof, even rates of paternity fraud have gone up, getting married and having children in these times is a joke  Etc  THE ONLY THINGS THAT ARE GOOD ABOUT WOMEN, ARE THE THINGS THAT MEN FORCE THEM TO DO	https://incels.is/threads/all-good-things-women-are-known-for-were-ironically-roles-enforced-by-men.123633/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_all_good_things_women_are_known_for_were_ironically_roles_enforced_by_men.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_all_good_things_women_are_known_for_were_ironically_roles_enforced_by_men.tsv	1558996073	Blackpill All Good Things Women Are Known For Were Ironically Roles Enforced By Men	21	1K	0

Over 1,100 students replied to the annual survey, which is nonscientific and optional for students. The survey focused on a number of topics, including relationships, sexual history, sexual orientation and sexual assault.  32.65 percent of respondents reported having never been in a relationship, while 41.82 percent of students surveyed said they were currently in a relationship.  The majority of respondents who have had sex (54.18 percent) reported losing their virginity between the ages of 17 and 18. 43.6 percent of those who reported having had sex did so for the first time while in college. Both of these figures are on par with the numbers reported in the 2016 sex survey.    if close to 100% of college foids are having sex, you need at least 40% of college men having sex to get close to that 76% are having sex, granted the ratio of foid to men are prolly around 52/48, more foids than men.   in a predominantly white college , yes 40% of white men are getting sex with multiple partners in a predominantly black college, yes, at least 40% of black men are having sex with multiple partners. 5.5 , taller than average, have extra beer money, yes,  after college probably not, unless he gain more status with a good white collar job.,  but then foids he meet will also have good paying white collar jobs also.  college is the only place where normies white can run a multiple partners harem. chadlite will have 50+ numbers in his black book Chad prolly 100+	https://incels.is/threads/white-college-normies-are-running-harems-on-campuses.246854/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/theory_white_college_normies_are_running_harems_on_campuses.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/theory_white_college_normies_are_running_harems_on_campuses.tsv	1601590807	Theory White college Normies are running harems on campuses	38	1K	25

Pretty much anyone who's not completely fucking mentally retarded can see that ethnics far more likely to engage in criminal behaviour than whites and asians. You'd have to be legitimately, medically handicapped to be so blind to the truth.  But I was googling trying to find data on this - specifically about sexual harassment and assualt - anyone who's read even one of my threads I'm anything but some tradcel who believes all the shit foids say, all the false accusations, but only an utter fucking moron would actually think there wasn't truth to the fact that non-Asians immgirants are just more likely to commit rape, sexual assault, etc.   So anyway, I googled 'immigrants more likely to sexually assault', and what the the top results? -The Hidden Nightmare of Sexual Violence on the Border -Dynamics of Sexual Assault and the Implications for Immigrant Women -LGBTQ migrants 97 times more likely to be sexually assaulted  So basically 2 articles about how immigrant foids are more likely to be assaulted, and one about ridiculous, not even worth mentioning more tranny shit.  It's fucking RIDICULOUS how google just intentionally hides studies and evidence on something which is so obviously true. You'll see it yourself - searches NEVER autocomplete anything which could be perceived as racist, sexist, and so on. For example:    Let's be honest. There is absolutely NO that these are the most searched things. For blacks I would almost guarantee it'd be 'Why are black people so violent', or whatever, and for whites it'd probably be 'Why are white people so pettty', or 'pathetic', 'sensitive', you know. 'Why are asian people' doesn't even autocomplete for me.

0	1602156942	PM_ME_STRIPPERS	It came to my mind that females effectively sexually assault males and especially incels with the way they dress and behave in public/online. Females purposely choose clothes that reveal/tightly fit as much flesh as possible without risk of drawing societal disdain on themselves. The risk is noticeably diminishing day after day.  They openly give hugs and kisses to males they like, post their half naked bodies on their social networks pages and even stream their female assets on Twitch or through the notorious Snapchat. and to top it off, desperate beta males pay real money they've earned through working long hours to see that. They never get to touch the foid, let alone have an encounter.

16	1599747751	Wizard32	Pretty much. 3 kids together but apparently never lived together during the 8 years they've fucked. She said he assaults her twice annually when drinking heavily, so that would be FIFTEEN prior assaults. Unclear how many (if any) she reported prior to this.  Basically how the story goes is Laquisha Booker (the LNB at [http://archive.is/YcYRU](https://archive.fo/YcYRU) not sure what middle initial N stands for) filed a sexual assault charge against Jacob S. Blake (Jacob Blake Junior) in May 2020.  This was class 3 (forced sexual 'intercourse') because Wisconsin classifies ANY body part (or object) entering another's body as intercourse.  In this case Laquisha alleges he put 1 finger into her vagina without permission. She also alleged that afterwards, he stole her credit card (Great Lakes, made 2 withdrawals of $500 totalling $1000) and he stole the only pair of keys to her truck (Ford Explorer 2002)   Apparently in May they were broken up at the time (police report describes him as ex-BF). The cops showed up May 3 and Laquisha's sister Tamara reported May 4th that Jacob had dropped off the explorer (w/ keys) in her driveway.  Apparently in August when he was reported causing a disturbance at Laquisha's home (had 3 kids in an SUV .. presumably the 2002 Explorer he allegedly stole from her 3 months prior) the cops pulled up his dox and realized he had the sexual assault charge pending.  The weird thing is, news reported Laquisha as his 'fiance' so it seems like they went from ex-BF/ex-GF in May to fiancees in August? Very confusing. Is this how relationships work in black communities, blackcels? Lady goes from calling cops saying he assaulted her vagina and penetrated her without permission and got a restraining order, and then agrees to marry him, but doesn't withdraw the police charges or retrstraining order? WTF...  like WHEN exactly did they two get engaged? Was it AFTER the cops shot him? LOL bro you have to know me and my previous posts to understand the humor here.  Seriously it's going to ruin my plans if I have to explain too much. Basically: just pretend we are pro-Blake and pro-BLM so that when IT attacks us for it, we can sic the BLM mob on IT.

Laquisha was the one who called the cops BTW, saying he violated the order (so she was aware it was still there) and had stole her keys again [https://quillette.com/2020/09/08/police-violence-and-the-rush-to-judgment/](https://quillette.com/2020/09/08/police-violence-and-the-rush-to-judgment/)  If he stole the keys to the Ford Explorer 2002 a 2nd time and the kids were in it, then he was basically trying to kidnap them in it.  IE if he's being send to jail by his ex-GF (who for some reason is a 'fiancee' despite having an active restraining order against him still, which she uses?) then he might try to get revenge by hurting the kids, so I expect the officer shot Blake to protect those 3 beautiful black babies as his primary concern, with self-defense being a secondary motive.  If these guys were actually gunhappy they wouldn't have started off with tasers, or would've shot him when he resisted the tasers and kept fighting.

When you limit their behavior especially their sexuality/sexual expression, you are in the Hitler spectrum. That at the same time 'sexualizing children' (meant are the 'Guuuuuuurls from above) is also a hitleresque crime that makes the insanity complete.  For Leftists it cannot be early enough to make children known to sex practices, LGBT, sex toys, condoms, transsexuality etc., but if they then start early to act like thot's and rapists (I remember many cases of sexual assault of 9-11 year old boys in the media too), then it must be toxic masculinity and capitalist patriarchate.	https://incels.is/threads/lol-its-happening-pedophilia-is-getting-normalized-it-will-touch-this.233425/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_lol_its_happening_pedophilia_is_getting_normalized_it_will_touch_this.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_lol_its_happening_pedophilia_is_getting_normalized_it_will_touch_this.tsv	1597914121	JFL Lol, it’s happening.

40	1597119892	Edmund_Kemper	You believe in way too many myths the media tells. Only 1% of murders involve sexual assault according to data. It’s extremely rare for molesters to kill their victims and if they do it’s usually solely because they’re worried their victim will report. Also, many child molesters who only fondle, don’t rape. So stop believing myths based on what media says. Also, no, you wouldn’t be traumatized just by some retard touching your penis and walking away. It’s just a finger on some body part. Getting kicked in the balls hurts way more.

Its simple really, in one case the woman felt like she was duly cpmpensated, in the other she felt like she was robbed of something, that's the only difference, the difference between rape and prostitution is the feeling of being compensated (be that validation from males she desires or money, its the lack of compensation that women see as the violation, not the act itself)	https://incels.is/threads/is-rape-really-such-a-bad-thing.230101/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_is_rape_really_such_a_bad_thing.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_is_rape_really_such_a_bad_thing.tsv	1596913230	Serious Is Rape really such a bad thing?	130	3K	89

It's still almost always rape of females but it's rare for anyone to really care or make a fuss about it.   But as soon as you put that shit on screen all hell breaks loose. Game of thrones is a perfect example. No one cared about all the raping, sexual assault, and sexual content in the books but as soon as it was on screen it was controversial as fuck. No one cared about the men constantly having their heads chopped off, being burned to death with liquid gold, or forced castration though.	https://incels.is/threads/why-is-murder-commonly-depicted-in-tv-and-video-games-but-not-rape.227737/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/hypocrisy_why_is_murder_commonly_depicted_in_tv_and_video_games_but_not_rape.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/hypocrisy_why_is_murder_commonly_depicted_in_tv_and_video_games_but_not_rape.tsv	1596230867	Hypocrisy Why is murder commonly depicted in TV and video games but not rape?	39	730	22
27	1593993973	Deleted member 27204	 Tbh a lot of people talk about how bad westernized curries have it, but curries in the subcontinent that are already having some of the same issues already face a far worse situation in the future.  The push to fight against arranged marriage of any kind and tighten domestic violence laws to draconian western standards has been accompanied by many women there cheering it on and taking every opportunity to bash Indian men. The media compounds the issue by reporting on every rape and sexual assault that occurs and broadcasting it nationwide for other international news media to pick up, painting all Indian males as rapists. In this framework, even with absence of any controls on female sexuality, any push for preserving a way for low status males in India to cope is dismissed because women seen as suffering more, and after centuries of being prevented from doing so, Indian women are seizing every opportunity they can to not only abandon Indian men but also make sure the Indian men aren't able to cope without being shamed as 'mommy's boys' and 'manchilds'.  The worst thing is that despite all the memes about Indians online, a lot of them still aren't even aware of the perception they have gotten in the world. For them ignorance is bliss. I am sure they are more occupied with the border dispute involving India and China that happened recently.  Pakistan could face much the same issues that India does, and with lack of resources extremism could become more common. Pakistan-India-China could be flashpoints for global conflict by the mid 21st century so I wouldn't want to be in those areas. That is before even factoring in climate change.	https://incels.is/threads/indian-men-why-do-you-go-to-white-nations.220168/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_indian_men_why_do_you_go_to_white_nations.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_indian_men_why_do_you_go_to_white_nations.tsv	1593943856	Serious Indian men, why do you go to white nations?	67	3K	27

Not us. VAWA isn't directly responsible for due process failures, those were already a pre-existing issue involving local/state police departments.  Morrison wasn't a civil liberties case, but a federalism case -- more specifically, Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution.  If there's anything that I most disagree with Biden with, in the context of the incel community, it would be his initiative to have the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights' to apply Title IX to cases of campus sexual assault. It was clear the Obama administration failed to place sufficient procedural safeguards to protect due process rights of the accused. Thankfully that issue has been rectified by DeVos, the only thing she's done in her tenure as Ed Sec that made any sense.  I think the debacles involving VAWA and Title IX, if anything, demonstrate the need for reasonable jurists in the federal courts. That's something that the Trump administration I think will not provide.	https://incels.is/threads/incels-cucktears-and-free-speech-why-another-term-of-trump-would-harm-american-incels-civil-liberties.225815/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_incels_cucktears_and_free_speech_why_another_term_of_trump_would_harm_american_incels_civil_.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_incels_cucktears_and_free_speech_why_another_term_of_trump_would_harm_american_incels_civil_.tsv	1595622956	Serious Incels, CuckTears, and free speech: why another term of Trump would harm American incels' civil liberties	31	861	19
0	1595805819	Edmund_Kemper	Studies have shown that rape victims usually are very young women and that young women and teen girls are the most frequently raped.  According to [Bureau of Justice Statistics](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/apvsvc.pdf), the most frequently raped age group is 18-21. 15-17 and 22-24 are nearly just as frequently. All the other listed age groups are significantly less commonly raped, the least common being 50+. The average age of a rape victim is 27, but this included uncommon outliers who are much older. The median age is 23. I remember another study reporting the median age of a rape victim as 21 or 22.   [According to RAINN](https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence), Females ages 16-19 are 4 times more likely than the general population to be victims of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. Women ages 18-24 who are college students are 3 times more likely than women in general to experience sexual violence. Females of the same age who are not enrolled in college are 4 times more likely.  another [study](https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/Digitization/146474NCJRS.pdf) reveals 16-25 year old women are 3 times more likely to be raped than other women. It also reveals that 38% of acquaintance rape victims are 14-17 year olds. (Acquaintance rape is rape by someone you know, like acquaintances of course or friends, intimate partners, spouses, coworkers, relatives, etc) most rape is acquaintance rape.  According to [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/NISVS_Report2010-a.pdf), Most female victims of completed rape (79.6%) experienced their first rape before the age of 25; 42.2% experienced their first completed rape before the age of 18 years. This means 37.4% of female victims of completed rape experienced their first completed rape at age 18-24  [another study](https://www.nolasart.org/statistics.html) reveals that 65% of sexual assault victims are 12-29 years old. 80-44=36 and 26+29=65. When you remove the victims who are below 12 you get this. I read that 17 million American women have been raped for a period of time. 17,000,000 x .15 = 2,550,000. 17,000,000-2,550,000=14,450,000 were 12 or older. 17,000,000 x .29=4,930,000 and that number divided by 14.45 million is 34.12% of victims being 12-17. 17 million x .36 = 6,120,000. 6.12 million divided by 14.45 million is 42.35% being 18-29. 34.12+42.35=76.47% of victims being 12-29. I decided to remove the victims below 12 because rapists often who rape young adults often might be prone to raping jb foids too. I remember reading that child molestation is technically 13 and below while 14-17 is statutory rape and those below 13 and more likely to be victims of other sexual assault while those over 13 are more likely to be victims of rape. So I wanted to show you what age group the normal rapists target instead of just all including child molesters.  I also read that the modal age of a rape victim is 15. Also, studies show that even men in their 30s, 40s, 50s etc mostly have very young victims (ie: teen girls and women in their early 20s). [Studies](https://richardfelson.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/sex-assault-archives_onlinepdf.pdf) also show that inmates usually tend to rape young inmates, and older inmates are more likely to sexually assault than physically assault other inmates. The average age of a prison rape victim is 21-23 while the modal age is 18/19.  the most common age group of an acquaintance rape victim is 15-24 and most rape in general is acquaintance rape. The most common age group of date rape victims is late teens early 20s. One of the studies I cited shows this too:  “Studies of the risk of sexual assault during other crimes suggests that young women are much more likely to be victimized than older women even when they have similar levels of contact and vulnerability. For example, Felson and Cundiff (2012) used the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS) to examine the effects of age of the victim on whether male offenders committed sexual assaults during robberies of female victims. They found that male offenders were most likely to commit sexual assault while robbing women between the ages of 15 and 29 years (see also Felson & Krohn, 1990). This pattern was observed regardless of the age of the offender. Other research has shown that female homicide victims who had been raped were younger than female homicide victims who had been the victim of theft (Shackelford, 2002; Wilson, Daly, & Scheib, 1997). The age pattern observed in these studies supports the idea that opportunity factors cannot fully explain why the victims of sexual assault tend to be young women. The sexual attractiveness of young women seems to be the most convincing explanation of the strong age pattern that remains when opportunity factors are controlled”	https://incels.is/threads/data-rape-victims-tend-to-be-very-young-women-in-their-teens-and-early-20s.226425/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/data_rape_victims_tend_to_be_very_young_women_in_their_teens_and_early_20s.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/data_rape_victims_tend_to_be_very_young_women_in_their_teens_and_early_20s.tsv	1595805819	[Data] Rape victims tend to be very young women in their teens and early 20s	53	2K	0
0	1595639103	Edmund_Kemper	I found more and more proof that rapists are often chads.  In a research paper called The Undetected Rapist by David Lisak, it revealed the following:  ''Undetected rapists' have consistently been shown to more sexually active than other men. Apart from their sexually aggressive behavior, they engage in consensual and coercive sex far more often than is typical for men of their age group. Their sexual activity tends to be an important component of their identities. Thus, rather than being a product of a greater sex drive, their increased sexual activity appears to be driven by their view that if they are not very active then they are neither 'successful' nor adequate as men.'  Now some bluepilled cuck might argue 'silly little inkwell don't you know that they only have lots of sex to be adequate as men?  ' but the thing is is that many men who try to be extremely sexually active probably won't be that sexually active, and either will remain incel or will just be moderately sexually active. i'm sure many chads have lots of sex for this reason, given the pressure to have sex among men in society. So if rapists succeed at being much more sexually active than most men, then they're clearly chick magnet chads.  In the book [Rape Investigation Handbook](https://books.google.com/books?id=EtdMobTttnwC&pg=PA17&lpg=PA17&dq=rapists+%22sexual+dysfunction%22&source=bl&ots=ZVsXu-79ku&sig=ACfU3U3synMA4gN1R9a2gM1HhfReLWnOyA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjDweuJ_ubqAhWUlnIEHeYHAaIQ6AEwCHoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=rapists%20%22sexual%20dysfunction%22&f=false) by John O. Savino and Brent E. Turvey, they showed studies showing how many rapists attract women and are sexually active with many women. 'Groth (1979, p. 5) dispels the myth of the predominance of 'loner' and socially outcast rapists by explaining that 'one third of the offenders that we worked with were married and sexually active with their wives at the time of their assaults. . . . Of those offenders who were not married (that is, single, seperated, or divorced), the majority were actively involved in a variety of consenting sexual relationships with other persons at the time of their offenses.' Also, 'furthermore, Groth and Hobson (1983, p. 161), who studied 1,000 offenders over a 16-year period, found the following: 'All of the offenders we have seen were sexually active males involved in consensual relationships at the time of their offense. No one raped because he had no other outlet for his sexual needs.'  I also have read that college athletes and frat boys are significantly more likely to perpetrate rape, sexual assault, or sexual coercion. 1 in 3 college rapes is done by a college athlete. Another study showed college athletes in a uni being responsible for 19% of sexual assaults and 35% of domestic assaults despite being only about 3% of the student population. Another study showed that 54% of college athletes reported perpetrating some form of sexual coercion. Sorority girls are also more likely to be victims of rape than other college girls.	https://incels.is/threads/personalitypill.225870/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/personalitypill.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/personalitypill.tsv	1595639103	[Personalitypill]	22	590	0

51	1595378495	Robtical	According to cucks and rosties, sex isn't important for non-chads, even though not having it causes mental problems and decreases life expectancy.  Rosties don't care about our health or life expectancy, yet they feel entitled to non-chad's tax money and simping to keep their smv high. Our lives mean much less to rosties than them being able to fuck chads and getting free stuff. That's why they say sex isn't important and 'not a big deal' yet act like the world is coming to an end when a foid with a short skirt gets her ass grabbed at the supermarket. If sex wasn't important then sexual assault and cheating wouldn't be a big deal.  They want to trick non-chads into thinking they're not missing out on anything so they can stay quiet and stop talking about the blackpill. They want us to believe sex isn't important, but marrying old used rosties, following cucked laws, and paying taxes to used whores who reject us is important.	https://incels.is/threads/3-months-since-i-left-the-incel-community-an-update.224888/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/soy_3_months_since_i_left_the_incel_community_an_update.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/soy_3_months_since_i_left_the_incel_community_an_update.tsv	1595352379	"Soy ""3 months since i left the incel community - an update"""	53	2K	51

0	1594587378	Edmund_Kemper	I've done lots of research on rapists, and i read that a majority of rapists have multiple victims, so most rapists are serial, but very few rapists are reported, and very few end up in jail.  [Studies](http://www.ncdsv.org/images/RapeFactSheet-UndetectedRapist.pdf) have shown that 5%-14.9% of men are rapists. Undetected rapists (rapists who aren't reported or arrested) are known for being highly manipulative and are good at grooming their victims for attack and isolating their victims physically to plan the rape. Here's a quote:   “Undetected” rapists have consistently been shown to more sexually active than other men. Apart from their sexually aggressive behavior, they engage in consensual and coercive sex far more often that is typical for men of their age group. Their sexual activity tends to be an important component of their identities. Thus, rather than being a product of greater sex drive, their increased sexual activity appears to be driven by their view that if they are not very active then they are neither “successful” nor adequate as men.  Undetected rapists (the vast majority of rapists are undetected) tend to sexually successful slayers and manage to sexually attract a lot of women (which you need to do to have lots and lots of sex). Rapists also tend to have a lot of misogyny and hostile opinions about women. Here's [another quote](https://www.msudenver.edu/media/content/studentengagementandwellness/STEPUP_SexualAssault_Myths_and_Facts.pdf) from another citation:  The stereotypical image of the rapist is that he is 'abnormal' and easy to identify. In media, rapists are often of portrayed as deranged criminals. The majority of rapists act and appear relatively 'normal.' Serial “acquaintance rapists”are often extremely charismatic.  Most rape is acquaintance rape (raped by someone they know, like a boyfriend/husband, friend, classmate, co-worker, relative, teacher, etc.) and a majority of rapists are serial rapists.  I also read that frat boys are 3 times more likely to rape and sexually assault women, and frat boys often are chads and sexually successful slayers hanging out with stacys. According to [Campus Safety Magazine](https://web.archive.org/web/20170629090833/https://www.campussafetymagazine.com/safety/sexual-assault-statistics-and-myths/), 'College men who participated in aggressive sports (including football, basketball, wrestling and soccer) in high school used more sexual coercion (along with physical and psychological aggression) in their college dating relationships than men who had not. This group also scored higher on attitudinal measures thought to be associated with sexual coercion, such as sexism, acceptance of violence, hostility toward women and rape myth acceptance.'  In DEAR STUDENT-ATHLETE: A closer look at how college athletics departments are addressing sexual misconduct by Nia Vogel, Vogel writes 'The group of students at the greatest risk of being responsible for sexual assault against a peer is male student athletes. Statistics reveal that although male college athletes represent less than 4% of colleges’ student body, that group commits about 20% of reported sexual assaults.' In [another study](https://camd.northeastern.edu/rugglesmedia/2016/10/28/sports-and-cultures-of-violence-a-look-back-at-major-incidents/) it shows that college athletes were 3% of the population but 19% of sexual assaults and like 35% of domestic assaults, and 54% of college athletes admitted to perpetrating some form of sexual coercion. 1 in 3 college rapes is committed by an athlete. [According to Time magazine](https://time.com/3689368/campus-sexual-assault-athletes-yes-means-yes/), 'A 1995 [review of reported sexual assault cases](http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/NCAANewsArchive/2003/Editorial/policy%2Balone%2Bis%2Bnot%2Ba%2Bdeterrent%2Bto%2Bviolence%2B-%2B5-26-03.html) at schools with Division I sports programs found that although male student-athletes made up only 3.3% of the campus population at these schools, they accounted for 19% of sexual assault perpetrators and 35% of domestic violence perpetrators. Related research has also found that athletes are far less likely to be convicted of sexual assault than members of the general public. These statistics should be shocking, but sadly they probably aren’t to most people.'

And many friends I make are bluepilled Af and they all GENUINELY think I’m bluepilled. It is NOT hard to hide it. For Fock sake. If it’s so hard, then date rape, domestic abuse, etc would never happen  I mean for fuck sake [studies](https://www.csbsju.edu/Documents/Counseling%20and%20Health%20Promotions/CERTS/UndetectedRapist.pdf) show that many rapists are much more sexually active than is typical of men their age, and if they can have consensual sex with so many foids, they clearly can easily hide that they’re going to rape a few of them. Ted bundy easily tricked his victims. It was easy as pie. And don’t say Ted bundy had to fake injuries cause he had fuckin gf one time. [Studies](https://www.msudenver.edu/media/content/studentengagementandwellness/STEPUP_SexualAssault_Myths_and_Facts.pdf) show that most rapists are very normal people and many serial acquaintance rapists (meaning they rape someone they know) tend to be very charismatic. Here’s another quote: “Usually, women are sexually assaulted by someone they know —someone who has already been identified as safe and non-threatening. In college, acquaintance rape accounts for approximately 90% of completed and attempted sexual assaults. Community surveys reveal that approximately 80% of rape is acquaintance rape.“  Jesus fuck the dead body Christ, their mental gymnastics are so fucking insane it’s retarded ERfuel.	https://incels.is/threads/this-is-the-female-cucktear-making-fun-of-you-for-being-an-inkwellerino.222006/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_this_is_the_female_cucktear_making_fun_of_you_for_being_an_inkwellerino.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_this_is_the_female_cucktear_making_fun_of_you_for_being_an_inkwellerino.tsv	1594497162	JFL This is the female cucktear making fun of you for being an inkwellerino	27	778	14
0	1594307124	Nicotine	 View: https://twitter.com/mo0nlitruby/status/1280127918451101699   You may have seen this on Twitter, especially if you’re a Texan. This is not sexual assault. This is not groping. This is a patdown with open palms and wrists facing outwards. The Austin PD posted their policy about patting down women and defended the officer. Should be case closed, right?   View: https://twitter.com/goblinbabes/status/1280695840810680321   This is a quote-tweet of the APD patdown video, with some SERIOUS accusations leveled against the officer. Check out the thread and read the screencap of the gofundme link with the alleged allegations of this cop against the woman.  TL;DR - the cop is accused of rape, child rape, domestic abuse, and stalking  Now this struck me as odd. Several capital crimes over 9 years and nothing was done? Huh. That seems weird. So I looked into it. I googled her name. And a little ways down on the first page of google was the link to a Justia page with full document of the outcome of the custody case of Brian O’Quinn, the officer, and Rosalinda Trevino, the arrested woman.  [https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/third-court-of-appeals/2019/03-18-00197-cv.html](https://law.justia.com/cases/texas/third-court-of-appeals/2019/03-18-00197-cv.html)  So I read through this. A bit over half of the 18 pages. And I ignored the parts that came from Austin PD detectives. Because let’s give her, the so-called victim, the benefit of the doubt and assume that the APD detectives were covering for the capital crimes of their police brothers.  And I found this:       TL;DR for the images - The guardian ad litem (an objective, impartial person who the court appoints to act as a representative for minor children in a contested custody proceeding) found the woman to be schizotypal. The objective party found the woman to be a schizo and unfit to care for a child. A detective (from a different police department to the officer being accused, so there’s no collusion or corruption) deems the woman unfit to care for the child. The court agrees on all counts and she loses custody.  Somehow, shockingly enough, Twitter didn’t seem to catch on to this custody case. No one else seemed interested in finding the truth. I seem to be the only person who gave this tweet more than 5 seconds of thought. No one of the 333,000 likes to decide “hmm, this deserves a second look”. And the tweet (with 185k retweets) and the change.org petition (with 160k supporters) are still up, with a schizoid’s testimony being treated as color of law in order to ruin this man’s life. Her word is gospel, because she’s a perfect woman and he’s a pig cop/male.  This man’s life is over. The first google results for his name will be tweets about him being a rapist and a pedo and an assaulter. And they’re not only unfounded allegations, they have already been proven to be false in court. But that doesn’t matter. Not in 2020. What matters in 2020 is the word of a schizoid foid, because even a schizo is more trustworthy than a pig male cop   I am beyond seething right now. Modern soyciety is a fucking joke. 50 years ago, this would be local news, the court case would come out, she would be charged with libel, and his name would be cleared. In 2020, Twitter is the judge, jury, and executioner for the quality of the remaining years of his life. And his life is now over.

0	1593735815	Edmund_Kemper	   before you guy 'don't post about IT' yeah i know but i post less frequently about them now  anyways, it's funny how IT think it's wrong to joke about rape but then they advocate rape as a punishment for someone who didn't even rape someone. first of all, i don't condone rape, even rape of a woman, but if you condemn rape then advocate it as a punishment, you're a hypocrite who is essentially saying 'sometimes rape is a good thing' and even feminazis are condemning advocating rape as a punishment, saying it perpetuates 'rape culture'. no, nobody deserves to be raped regardless of who they are and rape is never okay.  also, IT clearly don't know much about prison. Prison rape doesn't actually happen as much as people say it does. It's unconfirmed how prevalent it is because many inmates, even in surveys, are afraid to say they've been raped, but studies conjecture that the percent is probably around [9%-23%](https://web.archive.org/web/20081010170831/http://www.hawaii.edu/hivandaids/Tg/Breaking_Out_of_the_Prison_Hierarchy__Transgender_Prisoners,_Rape,_and_the_Eighth_Amendment.pdf). Also, most inmates don't worry about being raped in prison. The Sexual Health and Attitudes of Australian Prisoners (SHAAP) study has recently released [findings](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-015-0653-7) about the factors associated with sexual coercion among men in Australian prisons. The [study](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10508-010-9667-3) of over 2000 male prisoners in Australia found that sexual coercion in prison was actually much less commonly reported than is generally believed. Almost a third of participants had feared being sexually assaulted in prison before they were incarcerated, but once they were in prison a much smaller (though still significant) proportion (7%) reported being frightened about the possibility of sexual assault. In 1974, Carl Weiss and David James Friar wrote that 46 million Americans would one day be incarcerated; of that number, they held that 10 million would be raped aka 21.74% of inmates.  Also, when prison rape happens, only specific types of inmates get raped. Inmates don't rape anyone they hate. They usually rape those who remind them of women. Many believe this myth that being gay is accepted in prison. In reality, inmates actually hate gay people as much they hate sex offenders and snitches. They only rape others in prison because, according to research, they don't have access to women in prison and thus pick other inmates as a substitute because they crave sex. In fact, there's this rule in prison that you're only gay if you're the one being anally penetrated or sucking the penis, if you're the one doing the penetration or receiving fellatio you aren't considered gay. That's the rule in prison because it's women who receive penetration or give head.   Inmates tend to rape those who they perceive as feminine usually. [For example, young inmates tend to be raped the most in prison](https://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/prison/report4.html#N_188_), with the average age of a prison rape victim being 21-23 and the modal age being 18-19. [16/17 year old guys who are put in adult prisons also get raped in there much more than 18+ year old inmates](https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/06/05/when-to-punish-a-young-offender-and-when-to-rehabilitate/in-prison-teenagers-become-prey). Not only do very young inmates get raped, but also inmates with youthful appearances get raped too. Young inmates often have youthful appearances, and men who look youthful are perceived as physically feminine by many inmates. One Florida inmate wrote (with spelling errors): 'Mostely young youthful Boy's are raped because of their youth and tenderness, and smooth skin that in the mind of the one duing the raping he think of the smooth skin and picture a woman . . . . Prisoners even fight each other over a youth without the young man knowing anything about it to see whom will have the Boy first as his property'. Also, white inmates are often raped more than inmates of color, and young white middle-class males with a slight build are at the highest risk of prison rape. Gay inmates also are at a high risk of being raped in prison and so are transgender inmates. Older inmates and black inmates are significantly more likely to be perpetrators of rape and sexual assault in prison. Inmates who weigh less than others also are at risk of being raped or sexually assaulted.  Also, Alek Minassian went to prison, and despite Shaun Attwood's predictions he'd be killed on sight, the inmates were actually friendly to AM and asked him curious questions and had conversations with him. Also, many people like these guys are usually in their own cell by themselves regardless of how inmates would treat them due to being all over the news.    @JosefMengelecel i saw a thread you and others discussed on reddit.   @Robtical talked about how prison rape is prolly some gay fantasy bluepillers like to fap to.	https://incels.is/threads/it-advocate-rape-as-a-punishment-for-a-incel-bomber.219491/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/hypocrisy_it_advocate_rape_as_a_punishment_for_a_incel_bomber.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/hypocrisy_it_advocate_rape_as_a_punishment_for_a_incel_bomber.tsv	1593735815	"Hypocrisy IT advocate rape as a punishment for a ""incel"" bomber"	34	967	0

Over the weekend, Ismail was accused of cheating on his wife and lying about his marital status as part of a fresh wave of #metoo allegations - in the games industry and elsewhere  Other Ubisoft staff have faced sexual assault and harassment allegations in recent days. In a statement issued to Eurogamer on Tuesday, the company said: 'We are deeply concerned by these accusations. We take any allegations of abuse or harassment very seriously and we are looking very closely into the allegations to determine next steps.'   These are ALLEGATIONS. But he needs to step down to protect his job and his reputation because we exist in a fucking clown world.  If this isn't more proof added to the pile that women don't deserve the power they hold in society, than I dont know what is.

When asked if she was alright with the man kissing her, the woman said 'yeah, he's so hot!', blew the man a kiss, and yelled 'Text me!' Absolutely horrific to see another attack in Toronto carried out by an incel, a term which we all know refers to people who don't respect women, disregard consent, or hold right wing views like not wearing a mask during quarantine. This man is blackpill incarnate and it's unclear why this man isn't being labelled as an incel by the media or IncelTears considering he meets all the necessary requirements. I should repost this exact link but instead of using subtle satire I should just explain why this is a blackpill with simple words & clickbait that low IQlets can understand. Such as 'it's OK when Chad does it blackpill part 30' and explain in excruciating detail what happened in the video since none of you fuckwits are going to watch it anyways.  So I'll probably post this again with 'Chad kisses a random woman on live TV he doesn't know. It is clear that if he was UNATTRACTIVE he would be called an incel and the woman would cry rape. However due to the fact the man is physically attractive the media doesn't label him an incel and only refers to the act as 'non-consensual behaviour' when it's legally sexual assault, tries to cover up the original television broadcast, and refuses to call out the man whose identity is known. This incredible double standard yet again demonstrates why Toronto is the most incel city in the world. You can sexually assault someone on live TV and get away with it if you're Chad'  Then I'll end up with 200 replies which are all angry reaction images, memes, shit like 'pickle rick on a stick that's problematic soyerino', and other dumbass tier shit like 'massively multiplayer online thermonuclear multistage teller-ulam designed natural uranium tampered BLACKPILL'.	https://incels.is/threads/another-horrific-incel-attack-in-toronto-man-sexually-assaults-women-on-live-tv-with-a-nonconsensual-kiss.207325/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/another_horrific_incel_attack_in_toronto_man_sexually_assaults_women_on_live_tv_with_a_nonconsensual.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/another_horrific_incel_attack_in_toronto_man_sexually_assaults_women_on_live_tv_with_a_nonconsensual.tsv	1590210743	Another horrific incel attack in Toronto--man sexually assaults women on live TV with a nonconsensual kiss	15	1K	0
0	1592634775	DirtyCurryCell	I've been thinkig about this for a while now.  While it is true that women are the evil gender, we have to wonder why the our perception of society has always been that men are violent and women are soft. I think it is because for the longest time, we did live under a patriachy, and that oppressed women. A large amount of women were oppressed by a small amount of men.  There are a few foids in my life who are super nice to me. They know all about my weird kinks, and they know that I browse this site. Ofc, they constantly say dumb shit like 'Just don't be an incel <Anon>'. But what do they all have in common?  They're all victims of rape or sexual assault as children.  ;_;  And no, these are not screams for attention. A lot of this shit happened to them when they were children.  So what does this mean. I think it's because they were oppressed at a young age, they find chads to be repulsive, because they ooze mascuilinity. In fact, one of them actually told me that she finds chad unattractive, and she's dating her looksmatch. Likewise, with another foid I know, who's dating her looksmatch, her family was quite toxic.  While all the foids who go after chad and chad only are foids who are well of financially, have had stable/happy childhoods, and are pretty much spoilt brats who've always gotten their way. They think they're snowflake-princesses and they haven't been exposed to the real world.  It's like how when you live under an oppressive regime, and you're traumatized and beaten, and starved. And you learn to appreciate what you get when you finally escape.	https://incels.is/threads/women-mightve-been-more-kind-and-loving-in-the-past-because-the-patriachy-was-actually-violent-towards-them.216084/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_women_mightve_been_more_kind_and_loving_in_the_past_because_the_patriachy_was_actually_vi.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_women_mightve_been_more_kind_and_loving_in_the_past_because_the_patriachy_was_actually_vi.tsv	1592634775	Discussion Women might've been more kind and loving in the past, because the patriachy was actually violent towards them.	7	457	0

0	1592310015	AnonAutist	I was thinking about taharrush today, which is essentially mass rape/ public sexual assault by sexually frustrated(?) (usually) Muslim men, in the open, on random passer-by femoids.  Most famously former staceylite journofoid Lara Logan got taharrushed in Egypt in 2011 after the American Security State, the Deep State and the Obama State Department conspired and schemed to overthrow multiple Middle Eastern and North African autocratic governments via highly astroturfed 'Colour Revolutions'. Logan was on Tahrir Square in Cairo where roudy mobs were celebrating, she was joined by her cameraman and a local Egyptian fixer/translator.  This foid was the 'brave' blonde girlboss type - pretty funny how she tought it was a good idea to tempt fate by going to a lawless, disorderly square full of ecstatic illiterate scum in a revolutionary mood and interview them as a blond foid.      All of a sudden the mob turned on her, started pushing and shoving her, separated her from her companions. Logan got undressed by the mob, hair pulled out, groped everywhere, even inside bodily orifices, raped and sodomized multiple times, apparently even with blunt objects like flag poles. It went on for hours. She spent 4 days in the hospital recovering physically.    Taharrush-like incidents happened more often often between 2005 and 2013 on Tahrir Square. And in Germany and Sweden in December 2015 the rapefugees did a bunch of taharrushes on Western foids during New Year's Eve where foids were made to walk a gauntlet coming in and out of the main train stations. Most notoriously in Cologne, Germany, which made a lot of white nationalists and alt-rightards very angry.    In media there was a lot of speculation on why this happened - some brought up 'sexual frustration' because of polygamy in Islamic societies, but in the end, because the attackers were brown the PC shitlibs and feminists just blamed all men via 'toxic masculinity'.  Were the men in the mobs who commit taharrush incels? Shitlib pundits and cucks basically claim they were ('sexually frustrated') but most of these guys look pretty low inhib, extroverted, socialcirclemaxxed, thugmaxxed guys, be it lower class ones with little respect for 'liberal values' (lol). The same type of low class normie men who drunkenly harass foids in the city center at the end of evening on the weekends - and I think these men definitely do fuck foids and have gfs.  I figure most incels would have been at home LDARmaxxing during NYE and especially during CIA 'revolutions' and there is a general sphere of lawlessness.	https://incels.is/threads/taharrush.215446/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/taharrush.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/taharrush.tsv	1592310015	Taharrush	5	258	0

0	1592010995	Edmund_Kemper	if you said you hate anyone who is short, tall, has a big nose, has a deformed face, etc., people would just simply think you're kinda a jerk. but if you hate someone because they're black or latino or whatever, people will think you're this evil monster who should be violently beaten, ostracized, doxxed, have his life ruined or even KILLED. i think that hating someone for their race is just as bad as hating someone for their height, nose size, eye color, disability, etc.  and i don't want someone to say 'well the reason we're all sensitive about race is because of the killing and brutal treatment of blacks you inkwell' yet these same people don't care as much if you hate Arabs when Arabs had a million killed in Algeria, Palestinians killed and forced outta their homes, and Iraqis endure a war crime in the 2000s, etc. they still don't care as much if you hate Armenians when over a million were killed in the 1910s. society doesn't care much if you hate christians when the Soviet Union killed 12 million to 20 million christians and executed anyone who was religious (a fact that internet atheists deny, try being religious in USSR under Stalin).   i mean this idea that hating someone for their skin color is extremely evil because people have killed over race is dumb and is a guilt by assoication fallacy. it's like saying that because touching a foid's ass is sexual assault and so is rape, that means touching a foid's ass is a extremely evil thing to do (it really isn't but feminazis beg to differ). it's like saying that because America killed many Iraqi people, that means an American who hates Iraqis is as bad as a KKK leader. it's like saying that because many foids are domestic abuse victims and some have been killed by their husband, that means merely slapping a foid is an extremely evil and homicidal thing to do and makes you exactly like scott peterson or OJ simpson.   so therefore we can't compare someone who is merely racist to a guy who kills someone for their race. nobody would want to doxx you and kill you if you beat someone up because they have a big nose or because their voice is funny. but if you simply dislike someone for their race, you're an evil monster who should be doxxed and killed.  yes racism is bad but you can't act like it's evil to simply have racist thought crimes.  and as a Palestinian, i couldn't give 2 shits if someone said 'sand nigger' or 'towelhead'. in fact, i'd laugh a little.	https://incels.is/threads/hating-someone-for-their-race-isnt-worse-at-all-than-hating-someone-for-their-height-eye-color-nose-size-etc.214481/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/venting_hating_someone_for_their_race_isnt_worse_at_all_than_hating_someone_for_their_height_eye_col.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/venting_hating_someone_for_their_race_isnt_worse_at_all_than_hating_someone_for_their_height_eye_col.tsv	1592010995	Venting hating someone for their race isn't worse at all than hating someone for their height, eye color, nose size, etc.	14	540	0

84	1591122730	Wizard32	I disagree with the concept of crucifying pedophiles. Although I do not defend it, I think it's not necessarily a permanent affliction and that it should be possible to lure pedophiles into a more open-minded sense of who they could have as romantic partners.  I think many of us actually went through a pedophile phase when we were prepubescents ourselves, unless you ALWAYS preferred to to fuck big-tiddy post-pubescent women for as long as you had a libido.  I know I actually had a 2nd phase of it in my late adolescence where I began to get disgusted by post-pubescent and mid-pubescent sluttishness so my desire to be with a pure virgin made me prefer pre-pubescent girls for awhile. I eventually grew out of it (acquired some tolerance for foids who had a sexual history, grew more understanding of them ) so that instead of preferring pre-pubescent girls, I pretty much treat all three types (pre-pubescent, mid-pubescent and post-pubescent) equally enough that I can't say I significantly prefer one over the others. That's not to say there's some perfect eternal ⅓ ⅓ ⅓ balance or anything, it obviously fluctuates around, but never to the point that one stands out to me as 'best' for more than 6 months, which is what the DSM criteria requires.  You need to update your vocabulary pro, pedophilia is a paraphilia (a mental fixation on a particular criteria) not a 'practice'.  If you are referring to the actual act of fucking pre-pubescent girls, that's an entirely different thing done by pedophiles and non-pedophiles alike.  Fucking a foid doesn't mean you have a sexual preference for that foid's criteria. We see this with the thirst that leads to fucking landwhales. Sometimes guys who fuck pre-pubescent girls have standard post-pubescent preferences, but are situational offenders who prey upon younger girls because they seem more vulnerable and easy to manipulate.  I would hope any guys who feel a 6 month long fixation on pre-pubescent foids do not feel pressured to leave by comments like this. I don't think social exclusion is the answer here. The last thing these guys need is to think all non-pedophiles are a bunch of assholes who can't be talked to. This just leads them to congregate amongst themselves in an echo chamber environment and possibly get even more obsessed.  For those of us who appreciate the attractiveness of mid-pubescent and post-pubescent foids (and especially guys like me who also find pre-pubescent ones cute too) we have a lot to offer pedophiles in opening their minds to the appreciation of a wider variety of beauty. This could potentially lessen their mental fixation and maybe make them less of a mentalcel who might ascend with a woman they could legally fuck.  Of course if they'd still be incel even with mentalcel issues out of the way then I guess I should question if we'd be doing them any favors, because at least 'I don't want to fuck post-pubescent and mid-pubescent foids' gives them a 'volcel' kind of coping mechanism to avoid the pain of being rejected even by high-mileage carousel roasties which openminded incels have to face the pain of.  So OP basically what you're saying is if you live in Mexico and want to fuck 12 year old girls you can stay, but if you live in Bahrain or Portugal and want to fuck 20 year old girls you need to GTFO?  Simply wishing to fuck someone isn't disobeying those laws, and why the fuck do you care about subjective laws? What if they outlaw having an incel forum or an anime avatar? Have you never broken a piracy law?  I don't think 'not normal' really matters here, lots of not-normal stuff is fine. You're just talking about what crops up in the majority of populations, most likely, which isn't always good tendencies. It is 'normal' for foids to behave in many degenerate ways now, for example.  As for mentally ill: keep in mind there is an additional DSM parameter involved beyond 'attraction' here. It's preferential attraction for 6+ months that either leads to depression or illegal acts.  You can also get mentally ill from wanting to fuck post-pubescent foids and not being able to. There shouldn't really be a stigma around mental illness defined that way. I'd say at least 50% of this forum is suffering depression related to an inability to have intimacy with foids they're attracted to.  Normal doesn't really matter though, because the government could give us gay-inducing hormones and suddenly we're all fags and that's the new norm, but that doesn't make it right.  Do you think if people starting fucking babies as soon as they're born they're also 'already having sex anyways' and 'not innocent' and thus continuing to do so would be okay?  I don't think so, but perhaps 'having sex' implies a level of voluntary participation. But what are our standards for assessing how voluntary such participation is?  Even with baseline indicators of consent (positive body language or verbal affirmation) there is the idea of expecting someone to understand the context and details of what it is they're agreeing to. IE you could give verbal affirmation and positive body language at a gloryhole thinking a foid is giving you a BJ but if it terms out to be a fag giving the BJ on the other side of the wall and you got tricked, then that's sexual assault because your agreement was not given with adequate understanding of all facts involved.  Point of clarification: you could prefer post-pubescent foids and still be attracted to mid-pubescent foids.  Would you still call that hebephilia? I feel like we need terms to distinguish between 'mostly attracted to X' and 'also attracted to X'.  IE with a negress, I would fuck her (I think I'm attracted enough to get it up) but as a whole I would say I don't have a preference for negresses. So which is negressphilia?  If you want to get technical on the medical terms you have to keep in mind the three criteria you didn't mention: 6 months, suffering/illegality and overwhelming preference/fixation. You need that to fulfill DSM, not just 'attracted to' because we can be 'attracted to' a lot of stuff without it standing out as a paraphilia.  Thanks for arousing my attention, is there anything else in particular you wanted me to address besides the above?  COPE. I'll be the first to say I overwhelmingly prefer 2D to 3D these days but don't imply there's some 0% for 3D going on bro.  We're inherently upset with all male competition when we're not feeling romantic fulfillment tbh so this is cope.  We can still be of like minds on many subjects without agreeing on all topics Saxon  If the concern is 'don't fuck X or you'll probably go to jail' then this is a concern which also extends to foids above the Age of Consent as well.  This isn't merely about 'just fuck women who consent bro' because even if you did get a foid to momentarily consent, she can easily cry rape if she ends up regretting giving that consent and pretends she never gave it.  I think a lot of us recognize that and it makes us terrified of pursuing consensual sex with women. We may try in spite of that (being BRAVE - confronting out fears) but I think many foids recognize that terror and dry up because of it. So that would be a common mentalcel aspect.  This doesn't exist in a void either. It's not like this kind of mentalcel shit happens to gigachads. Gigachad is so 100% confident foids will enjoy his cock that he can just rape women if he wants (but he usually won't because they'll throw themselves on his cock before he even thinks to make an effort) because he is the reverse of us: even if a foid doesn't give consent she will likely enjoy the experience so much she'll retroactively give her consent and pretend she'd given it all along.  This mentalcel stuff happens to guys already incel or incel-adjacent because with being unattractive comes that uncertainty about whether a foid will enjoy it (even if she does consent) and that she might regret it and retroactively withdraw the consent and LARP as a rape victim. This is the factor which fucks with your personality when your looks are so bad you're barely on the cusp of getting consent to begin with with adequate confidence.  Werty why the fuck are using vague terms like 'young'? Be PARTICULAR about what you mean please, sir.  I think I know why.  Innocent of what? Knowledge? Fear?  Puberty is when foids start producing eggs to grow our babies in them. They should be accustomed to months of dicking by a good husband they've pair-bonded with by then.  There isn't anything corrupt about that.  If you want to talk about corruption then this is a much bigger umbrella of concern, like with indoctrination by certain parents ideals or media/TV suggestions, and it has to do with a lot more memes than just sexual ones.  For example: how many children are 'innocent' of being groomed to hate ugly men to a greater degree than their inherent biology would lead them to ? I think you'll find MANY girls start embracing the hatred of ugly men even before they start to embrace cock. That is arguably a much greater loss of innocence than merely licking dick.  Yeah, the virgin men in their 30s should stick to the 30s roasties who have had dozens of partners, it's only fair.    Only if you actually give them resources. Otherwise: maybe they're attempting to prostitute themselves through trickery but they fail, and that's on them.  I don't really follow your logic. If I get wealthy and own a house and I stop becoming an incel because a foid wants to fuck me because I have a house, I'm supporting inceldom by ceasing to be an incel?  Buxmaxxing supports non-genuine relationships but I don't think it's necessarily to blame for inceldom. I think you're looking in the wrong place for cause here.  oh gosh, I don't want to be WEIRD   I mean... at the base level I agree with you, but at the same time I think via cognitive behavior exercises it is actually possibly to gradually change your attraction triggers by changing your thought processes.  It wouldn't work for anything but just in terms of tweaking hangups to be more open-minded for example.  Like for example say I was thinking in terms of 'I just can't fuck a post-pubescent foid, all post-pubescent foids have taken at least a hundred cocks'.  As common as it is for that to be true, it's actually NOT an absolute rule. Hypothetically a minority of post-pubescent foids have taken less than 100 cocks.  So if I alter my cognition and tell myself 'hey wizard, that post-pubescent foid who probably took a hundred cocks? MAYBE she is an outlier who has only taken TEN cocks' and that's enough to reduce my disgust for her to make me want to fuck her: then suddenly the choice I have made to alter my perception of foids has actually altered whether or not (or to what degree) I find the roasty attractive. Make sense?  Untrue, puberty begins much lower than 14.  If you want to make distinctions between differeny tiers of mid-pubescent foids I guess we could split it in half like 'early pubescent' and 'late pubescent' but even then it would be hard to put concrete numbers on the upper/lower since there's some variety as to when it begins/ends in terms of years.  Some newfags should stfu and lurk more. It obviously doesn't unless you're adopting feminist memes where wanting to fuck anyone under 20 makes you a pedophile.  You might want to rephrase that Edmund, to 'find ANY 17 year old'. IE for each of us there are at least dozens if not hundreds of 17 year old girls we'd want to fuck.  Using a SINGULAR indefinite article ('a') however implies we could not find a particular seventeen year old unattractive, implying we are attractive to ALL seventeen year olds, which obviously isn't the case. The most obvious exception being 17 year old boys, but there are probably some unattractive 17 year old girls that some of us wouldn't be attracted to too.  why you want to fuck tweens, paedocel? our government issued GF must be 33+  Too young for what?  Do you consider yourself such an abusive lover that you would be guaranteed to harm a thirteen year old girl who wanted to date you, MLC?  Pedophilia is a paraphilia, not a crime.  We know better than most that attraction to a foid doesn't mean we're compelled to commit crimes to fuck her  This is cope. Admit it: you don't like seeing people in your age bracket dating foids either, because you're jealous of success either way. Your opinion will change once you're older and still a virgin and expected to settle for the foids finished fucking college-chad.  Here's an amazing idea: instead of dating in an 'age bracket' how about instead we have a 'partner bracket'.  IE let's try THIS out: it is more ethical to fuck someone with a similar partner count as your own.  If it turns out the only foids able to fulfill that are much younger, too fucking bad.  Dating foidsin general is risky for non-chads regardless of the age of the foid because a foid can regret fucking you and retroactively withdraw her consent and LARP as a rape victim.  The foid being underage just makes this LARPing easier so they're higher-risk, but there's already HUGE risk involved tbh.	https://incels.is/threads/pedos-should-fuck-off.210806/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_pedos_should_fuck_off.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_pedos_should_fuck_off.tsv	1591014829	Serious Pedos should fuck off	135	5K	84

'b-b-but she consented you silly inkwell you don't understand consent' no she didn't at the start. He just kissed her and she decided AFTER he started that it was okay. So the exact same action if done by an ugly man would be sexual assault.   It's literally your LOOKS that decide whether or not a crime took place hence sexual harassment / assault is nothing more than codified lookism. He acted (as many Chads do) without having any idea whether she 'consented' they do this often grab female's asses, kiss them, grope them, in some cases rape them, etc.   This is all tolerated and swept under the rug their entire lives yet we're supposed to take the #MeToo movement with the most utmost sincerity and be profoundly outraged at every case of sexual assault. How about no.   They also don't understand just how minuscule an action from an ugly man needs to be for it to be considered 'sexual harrasment' or 'sexual assault.' A simple compliment on how someone looks from an incel is 'sexual harrasment.' A touch on the arm (typical conversational touching) is as well. I even argued with people on IT that told me that poor kid getting arrested for touching a girl's arm was totally justified. Yet they all believe this guy should walk free because the girl decided it's okay that he did something without consent.

Of course, since he's attractive it's OK to the foid who actually says she's alright with it because 'he's hot'. Then screams after him to 'call me!'  It is clear that if he was UNATTRACTIVE he would be called an incel and the woman would cry rape. However due to the fact the man is physically attractive the media doesn't label him an incel and tries to avoid calling it sexual assault, using terms like 'non consensual'. Note how they're trying to get the video REMOVED. That's not because they actually believe this is wrong. If this was an unattractive this would be a media frenzy and this man would be prosecuted. Endless articles would be written about it. They're trying to get the video taken down BECAUSE even though it's sexual assault, it's ok, and they don't want more people being blackpilled by it especially in the current climate.   The crime wasn't that Chad sexually assaulted that woman. That was perfectly OK as evidenced by the woman being COMPLETELY FINE WITH IT. The crime was broadcasting the evidence that she was OK with it and potentially blackpilling even more people. Note how the man doesn't face any backlash whatsoever here. Only the media that showed and depicted the video received any sort of backlash. See how the apology is for AIRING the video and 'downplaying that this action was unacceptable', despite the fact that it obviously was acceptable to everyone in the scenario meaning the media would actually be lying by characterizing this action as unwanted.  That's because the strategy of the media is to tell you something COMPLETELY DIFFERENT from reality. You're supposed to think that 'Sure, everyone in real life is OK with Chad groping and randomly making out with women. But since the reliable media and news sources tell me that these actions aren't acceptable, clearly this is just an outlier! We don't actually live in a world where Chad can just grope, kiss, or assault whatever woman he pleases just because he's attractive.' because actually acknowledging that we live in a world where attractive men are allowed to do whatever they want to women because the woman wants it would be tantamount to accepting the blackpill. You see the same thing if you ever bother to get advice from IncelTears or whatever else. They will ALWAYS tell you that Tinder thots are 'outliers' or that 'not all women slut around' and try to convince you that what you're seeing isn't real and that REALITY is determined by a transvestite YouTuber who makes 'deradicalization' videos or by op-eds written by 'authoritative voices' on Twitter. The end goal of such or cognitive behaviour therapy is denying the very fact that you ARE an incel; that you are someone who's 'involuntarily celibate' and deny the very foundation of logic that 'A is equal to A' in favour of statements such as 'I might be involuntarily celibate but at least I'm not an incel'.	https://incels.is/threads/its-ok-when-chad-does-it-pt-30-massively-multiplayer-online-thermonuclear-multistage-teller-ulam-designed-natural-uranium-tampered-blackpill.207343/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_its_ok_when_chad_does_it_pt_30_massively_multiplayer_online_thermonuclear_multistage_telle.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_its_ok_when_chad_does_it_pt_30_massively_multiplayer_online_thermonuclear_multistage_telle.tsv	1590214438	Blackpill It's ok when Chad does it pt. 30. massively multiplayer online thermonuclear multistage teller-ulam designed natural uranium tampered BLACKPILL	6	593	0

8	1589763824	coppernicus	I agree, and I think it has a lot to do with the massive rape hysteria we're currently living on. Everybody is told that rape is the worst crime that can possibly happen to a woman, and the worst crime a man can commit, even comparing it with murder. I've seen posts talking about how a woman wasn't sure whether she was raped or not. How can it be a crime comparable to murder if you can't even be sure of whether or not it happened?  I personally don't see rape as any different from physical assault, in fact, I'd rather get raped than brutally beaten to a pulp, because objectively speaking the second one is worst, yet our laws disagree with this, and it makes no sense to me. I think the reason why woman want to make rape and sexual assault a bigger deal than what it is, is to gain power in their man hating agenda. They want to be able to put in jail any man who they don't like, I mean, they already can and actively do this. I know not all of them think this way, but there are some who do, and the ones that don't easily fall for the narratives of the ones who do.   >inb4 you can't know because you haven't been raped Then come rape me, roastie.	https://incels.is/threads/women-are-not-as-traumatized-as-they-pretend-to-be-about-rape.205001/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_women_are_not_as_traumatized_as_they_pretend_to_be_about_rape.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_women_are_not_as_traumatized_as_they_pretend_to_be_about_rape.tsv	1589761071	Serious Women are not as traumatized as they pretend to be about rape	20	1K	8

Example: if age of consent is 16 in your country, but you go to another country where it's 15 and fuck a 15-year-old, if they can prove you did it, they can charge you with sexual assault when you return home.

0	1587581035	Uglyme	Most cases of rape and female assault go unreported. Some studies show in 1/3 rapes women prefer not to report it. Others say its 65% while others say it's 96%. The general agreement is that 80% of sexual assaults are never reported to the police. Now I ask you, if rape is such a traumatic experience for women, wouldn't all of them report it to the police as soon as they can? Of course they give pathetic excuses for not giving away their perpetrators but I have one that makes more sense: in those cases women actually enjoyed being raped because it was done by Chad. If an ugly man dares to even touch a girl at work, he'd be fired and arrested the same say. But when Chad rapes a woman thats not considered rape so why would they report it? Interesting fact: the 80% percent of unreported rapes correlates with the 80/20 rule.

0	1586817465	streetlyte	We've all known and joked about forever that the difference between sexual harassment and flirting is whether or not the girl finds you attractive. It is a tragic reality that most normies refuse to acknowledge but they know deep down is 100% true.  Consider this scenario - pretend you are at a typical normie hangout spot. A bar, a party, a football game, whatever. There's a girl that you've been talking to and had a couple drinks with. You think it's going well and you're hitting it off so you make a bold, low-inhb move and full-palm grab her ass cheek. What happens next?  Your hand on her ass is an objective, inarguable event that just occurred, but something else is happening at the exact same time. It is 100% up to her SUBJECTIVE experience whether or not a crime was committed. Her subjective experience to your hand on her ass literally determines if you are a criminal or not.  If she liked it and/or likes you, no crime was committed. You are legally, and solely by her subjective experience, NOT a criminal. However if she didn't like it, you just committed sexual assault and now you ARE a criminal.  What determines if she liked it or not? Your looks. And being ugly means your chance of being a criminal are substantially higher, with the more attracted she is to you directly correlating to your likelihood of her pressing charges.  Even if she was the kind of girl that really doesn't want chads grabbing her ass (lol), do you really think she would report Chad to the police? She would at WORST tell him 'hey not cool man,' and stop talking to him.  But if she doesn't find you attractive? Congrats inkwell, you just committed sexual assault and your fate is completely in her hands.

I mean rape in the classic sense of 'abduction' (taking the hair away from the barbershop floor to my bedroom) and not in the sense of sexual assault.  I don't know that you can necessarily 'sexually assault' a dead remnant of a person's body anyway. Am I a rape victim if foid fucks a dildo made of my glued-together toenail clippings without having received my informed uncoerced consent to do so?  I just want to lie on a soft pillow. That you jump to sexual shows your prurient preoccupations.  Hair is only sexy IMO when it's still attached, preferably sentiently animated as faux-arms.

A year later. this same chic falsely accused one of my friends of sexual assault and got him black listed from every frat and sorority house on campus. A chadlite proceeded to do the same thing and she said it was 'consensual then' because he was good looking and my buddy was not. Almost killed himself because of it. She always says hi to me as if nothing has happened and that blows my mind. How could someone blatantly ruin someone's life and live their life un-phased. I guess I dodged a bullet.

Most of them agreed with each other in that death by boiling would be an excessive sentence for prosecutorial misconduct.  A couple of them suggested, however, that the death penalty would not be excessive in certain sexual assault cases even if the victim, or victims, did not die.  As far as I'm concerned, crimes involving moral injustice against institutions should be taken just as seriously as crimes involving injustice against individuals. The fact that someone who grabs a foid's butt receives a harsher punishment than someone who knowingly imprisoned an innocent person shows how little normies care about their civil liberties.  The biggest reason for this is probably the fact that the recipients of institutional injustice are men. Especially young men from disadvantaged backgrounds. If more femoids were wrongfully imprisoned, especially upper-middle-class white femoids, people would start to give a shit about the broken criminal justice system in many countries.	https://incels.is/threads/should-prosecutors-who-fail-to-disclose-exculpatory-evidence-to-defendants-be-boiled-alive.187911/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_should_prosecutors_who_fail_to_disclose_exculpatory_evidence_to_defendants_be_boiled_aliv.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_should_prosecutors_who_fail_to_disclose_exculpatory_evidence_to_defendants_be_boiled_aliv.tsv	1584775521	Discussion Should prosecutors who fail to disclose exculpatory evidence to defendants be boiled alive?	18	442	0
8	1584895604	BlkPillPres	 Thank you for stating the obvious, what is your point?, you are stating this as if I didn't know what it means, my entire point is that very mindset is a cope and completely false, can't you read? (that's been my entire point, that people who think this are coping)  In the same way that a rich person is more susceptible to 'degeneracy' poor people are more susceptible to 'criminality', so whereas a rich guy may end up fucking a bunch of whores a poor guy may end up murdering someone for money, I'd rather be committing 'rich sins' than 'poor sins', one is obviously more extreme, one usually involves 'victimless sins' while the other leads to a life of where you have to directly prey on others to survive or get what you want  You guys need to stop with this 'rich people are evil' cope, its poor people that are more 'evil' because they are subjected to worse living conditions and have to do more extreme things to survive, a boy born into a poor home is more likely to end up selling drugs, murdering, stealing, committing acts of sexual assault, etc, whereas a boy born into a rich home is more likely to become academically successful and be able to purchase all the things he wants (women included) and never have to commit any crimes  JUST COMMON SENSE ALONE DISPROVES THE NONSENSE ARGUMENT OF 'RICH PEOPLE SIN MORE'  Lastly, you have to see that you quite literally proved my point with your greed example: 'not donating a portion of the wealth to the betterment of the community (schools, hospitals, etc.)'  Why the hell should someone HAVE TO donate a portion of their wealth to others, that makes no sense, they are the ones who put the effort and planning into getting that wealth, its not objective its BS emotional thinking  Also it creates the subconscious rationalization that one should just stay poor because why work to become rich if it will all be taken away (or has to be given away)  This is the problem inherent to communism, why go through years of schooling to become a doctor if the majority of your income will be taken away to help fund other peoples lives, you might as well just get a simple job and spend less time studying  You are just proving more that religious doctrine subconsciously pushes people towards complacency, if I'm obligated to donate the wealth I earned, then why go through the hassle of acquiring wealth, there's no point, I could put in the same effort as a regular person and be obligated to give nothing because I 'don't have enough' and I can just relax and laze around and enjoy whatever meager copes my dollars can afford  This way of thinking offers no motivation for financial growth, it makes the poor proud of their poverty, and have an aversion to wealth building because it isn't worth it in the end, you literally just proved my point	https://incels.is/threads/hard-to-swallow-edition-most-humans-take-pride-in-their-suffering-trials-which-subconsciously-makes-them-complacent-failures-slave-mindset.188133/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_hard_to_swallow_edition_most_humans_take_pride_in_their_sufferingtrials_which_subconscious.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_hard_to_swallow_edition_most_humans_take_pride_in_their_sufferingtrials_which_subconscious.tsv	1584891630	Blackpill [Hard To Swallow Edition] Most Humans Take Pride In Their Suffering/Trials, Which Subconsciously Makes Them Complacent Failures (SLAVE MINDSET)	28	1K	8
0	1583285418	PPEcel	  One thing that I find fascinating is how normies and cucks -- many of whom claim to be liberals -- implicitly endorse the idea of prison rape. It is not uncommon to hear 'don't drop the soap' jokes in reference to a person who has been convicted of certain crimes -- domestic abuse, child sexual abuse, et cetera. Others don't go as far as to support sexual violence, but they generally praise physical violence in prison, perpetuated not by the state but by other inmates.  Some normies are somehow under the impression that physical and sexual assault in correctional facilities are a normatively desirable element of the criminal justice system. Considering that such assaults increase the risk of recidivism by undermining institutional authority and prisoners' mental health, you would think that these same normies would generally endorse a conception of prisons as tightly controlled and secure environments.  Indeed, I am not entirely sure why someone who ostensibly supports human rights and civil liberties would make exceptions for their principles in the case of, say, alleged or convicted rapists. In any case, those sanctimonious individuals lose any credibility when they next claim to hold the moral high ground.	https://incels.is/threads/cucktears-post-normie-trait-you-support-rape.183597/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/soy_cucktears_post_normie_trait_you_support_rape.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/soy_cucktears_post_normie_trait_you_support_rape.tsv	1583285418	Soy [CuckTears post] Normie trait: you support rape	41	1K	0

Woman beaters aren't cowardly. what they're doing is definitely bad but it isn't cowardly. Let me explain.  The reason woman beaters might beat up a woman is NOT because she's vulnerable or weaker. That's just some dumb assumption people make up just to trick themselves into think they're 'more brave' than the woman beater. Common motives for domestic violence against women include wanting to attempt to[ control their partner usually because of traditional beliefs about women, jealousy, difficulty in regulating anger, feeling inferior to their partner because of educational/socioeconomic background, etc.](https://psychcentral.com/lib/what-causes-domestic-violence/) and some saw or suffered abuse as a child. [Some domestic abusers](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4201052/) do it for power or control (eg.: assertion of dominance, punishing unwanted behavior, pent-up anger, control of physical/verbal behavior and emotional responses). so some do it to control their partner and get what they want in the relationship or because of anger. some do it for power but that doesn't mean they pick their wife because their wife is vulnerable. they probably pick to overpower their wife because their wife is who they live with. [Other common motives](https://www.verywellmind.com/domestic-abuse-why-do-they-do-it-62639) among wife-beaters include using violence to prevent their partner from cheating or leaving the relationship, the belief that men are supposed to be in charge of the relationship, etc.  A lot of wife-beaters are also big and strong, so i doubt they're afraid to beat up men and i'm sure most men can easily beat up men. How do I know? Here's how I know:  *Domestic violence is one of the most common crimes of professional athletes, including football players and wrestlers/fighters. look at ray rice, stone cold steve austin, floyd mayweather, greg hardy, dan wilkinson, etc.  *[Muscular men actually are more likely to be aggressive and more likely to be experienced in physical violence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398605/) and [this stereotype is true](https://psmag.com/social-justice/biff-was-born-nasty-and-then-he-got-some-bicepts)  *[Men focused on being muscular are more 'misogynistic'.](https://www.livescience.com/21172-men-sexist-attitudes-muscles.html)  *A lot of the domestic abusers i saw on google images look pretty strong.  *Hypermasculinity (aka emphasis on being as manly as possible, physical strength, and emphasis on aggression) often causes physical and sexual aggression towards women.  *I read a study that men who conform to masculine stereotypes and masculine norms/traditions are more likely to beat their intimate partner. Men who don't care about being manly are less likely to beat their intimate partner.  *Domestic violence is a problem in the military (and so is sexual assault). People in the military are tough and very strong.  If you beat up a woman BECAUSE she's vulnerable, then you might have a cowardly reason for punching her. but if that has NOTHING to do with your motive and you beat her up because you're mad at her and you would be ok with beating up strong men too, then you are NOT a coward at all. in fact, refusing to punch a woman because you're afraid to be called a woman beater and get hated by everyone is cowardly. the reason men often refuse to hit a woman is because they're afraid to be hated violently by everyone and they don't want to be seen as a woman beater. that's cowardly. if hitting a woman was allowed, men would do it. beating a woman takes more balls than beating up a big guy because the big guy will just beat you up and that's it. if you hit a woman, everyone will violently hate you and you'll be ostracized or even jailed. that's worse than getting beaten up by a big guy.  remember some good deeds are cowardly and some bad deeds are brave. you can be a cowardly hero or a brave villain. if you beat up a woman because she's pissing you off or you hate her and it has nothing to do with her being weaker, then how are you cowardly. what are you being afraid of? cowardly means being afraid. Beating up a woman takes a lot of balls and is brave despite being a bad thing to do.  men like this:     are way more likely to beat up a woman than girly men like this:  	https://incels.is/threads/woman-beaters-arent-cowardly-at-all.178423/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/venting_woman_beaters_arent_cowardly_at_all.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/venting_woman_beaters_arent_cowardly_at_all.tsv	1581646886	Venting woman beaters aren't cowardly at all.	61	2K	0

How are you having sexual activity? Does your sex doll have a sex count too? Does your hand have a sex everytime you (masturbate).   1. If two gay guys are having sex is it not sex because no woman is involved? Two people having sex together = sex. It doesnt matter if its anal or vaginal. They are both enjoying it therefore its sex.  2. If two lesbians are having sex but neither enjoyed it, did no sex take place? No. This situation would never happen. Why would 2 lesbians have sex with each other if neither enjoyed it? Maybe they are getting paid to do it for porn? Then it would be a business transaction. Maybe they are being forced to do it (since you said neither enjoyed it) then it would be some form of sexual assault.	https://incels.is/threads/if-you-have-consistent-access-to-prostitutes-you-cant-say-youre-a-truecel.177853/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/venting_if_you_have_consistent_access_to_prostitutes_you_cant_say_youre_a_truecel.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/venting_if_you_have_consistent_access_to_prostitutes_you_cant_say_youre_a_truecel.tsv	1581437040	Venting If you have consistent access to prostitutes, you can't say you're a truecel.	93	2K	25

18	1580829849	Wizard32	  You guys might want to specify which nation's laws you're talking about.  For example the 2012 Federal definition in the US: [https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape](https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/updated-definition-rape) “The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.”  So it is possible to charge a woman with raping a man if she puts a non-penis object into his anus without his consent. Like for example if she jams her finger (or a dildo, or a strapon, or her tongue) into your anus.  It's a step in the right direction, but the main problem is that it still doesn't cover 'forceful envelopement'.  1) it is rape to put your dick into woman's mouth without her consent, but it is NOT rape for a woman to put her mouth on your dick without your consent 2) it is rape to put your dick into vagina without consent, but NOT to put vagina on dick without consent 3) it is rape to put your finger into vagina without consent, but NOT for woman to grab your hand and push your fingers into her vagina  Fun fact though: it would not be rape to slap your dick on a woman's face, or ejaculate into her ear/nostril/eye because of this definition's specifics. This would fall under broader 'sexual assault' laws, so obviously don't do it.  One thing I don't really like is that apparently it's rape to put dick in woman's mouth without consent but NOT rape for a man to put tongue in another man's mouth without consent.  I don't see why they should be treated any differently. STDs can be spread by tongues and in both cases you're putting a slimy undesired body part into someone's oral cavity without permission.	https://incels.is/threads/the-concept-of-sexual-consent-only-applies-to-sub-8-men.175863/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/based_the_concept_of_sexual_consent_only_applies_to_sub_8_men.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/based_the_concept_of_sexual_consent_only_applies_to_sub_8_men.tsv	1580747456	Based The concept of sexual consent only applies to sub-8 men	18	691	18

My favourite article (   @Robtical is featured too) for laughs is linked below:      I've read the 262 page police report into the whole case and investigation, main things from it (off the top of head, what I remember) which confirm Incel sympathies and why I rate him:  His room mate described Beierle as a “recluse” and added that he was a “loner.” and never knew him to have any friends.  Foid neighbor said he used to avoid eye contact and keep his head down and blank her.  At high school, on finding out a foid was the only candidate for class president, he ran against her with the slogan: 'Vote Beierle, because we don't need no woman here.'  His mother confirmed he was “unsuccessful with romantic relationships.” She added, his standards were “abnormally high.”  He made a run at stand-up in a comedy club, until bookers told him his anti-Semitic jokes were not welcome   He tried to spark a social life through a Meetup.com group for local 20s and 30s. “We called him Nazi Scott,”  said a woman who belonged to the group. “He’d walk up and just start talking about weapons and killing people in the military and how Hitler was right to clear the human race of gays and Jews and blacks.”  He wrote of making a pilgrimage to Ted Bundy’s boarding house, and to Sorority Row, where the serial killer strangled two women who belonged to Chi Omega in 1978, the year St. Yogacel was born.  “Christians have their Via Delorosa in Jerusalem,” he wrote, “and I have mine.”  His sister-in-law and her husband, St. Yogacel's brother, considered contacting law enforcement in 2002 out of fear that St. Yogacel might be the D.C. sniper, who was then terrorizing the Washington area near where St. Yogacel had moved after college.  Based as fuck. Arrested multiple times for groping foid students:  Fired from the Leon County school system, for viewing porn at work.  One June afternoon in 2016, after a woman sunbathing by an apartment pool declined hiss offer to apply tanning lotion, he grabbed and shook her buttocks   On a December afternoon in 2012, Courtnee Connon, an 18-year-old freshman, was in an undergraduate dining hall when she felt a hand firmly on her rear end. She whirled around and found St. Yogacel, 6-foot-2 and 240 pounds, denying he had touched her on purpose.  But a few minutes later, she saw him grope another woman, then a third. All three, she said, were wearing yoga pants.  Volusia County schools hired him as a substitute teacher. He was fired within a year for touching a foid student on the midriff and asking if she was ticklish.  Investigated by police for making a foid student uncomfortable by touching her on the arm, suggesting she wear low-cut shirts and asking if she would ever pose in Playboy.  Emphasised with E.R, made a ton of videos about his failures with women, online dating, and basically how hypergamy is destroying humanity. Here's all his videos, I found them interesting:    Made an album of songs, inspired by his failures with foids:  #nowplaying Path of Defiance by Scott Beierle via @audiomack   There's many other nuggets in the report, which I have attached:  Basically to conclude, his attempts at interaction with foids and relationships were (bar a brief relationship in Germany, which ended with the foid leaving him, she wasn't good looking and St. Yogacel mentions her in the videos saying 'She was the best I could do') a total disaster. The frustration led to him unable to control his urges, thus getting in trouble multiple times for groping foids. He'd just turned 40, midlife crisis era, and was unemployed due to been arrested and fired multiple times for sexual assault, had a near empty bank account at the time of the attack, was reduced to wearing clothes that didn't fit, eating food directly from cans, bills were piling up, no prospects = a trip to the Yoga studio to 'unwind.'........

31	1578555425	PPEcel	 That's not the point of Blackstone's ratio. It's about:  1) the presumption of innocence 2) requiring a high evidentiary standard for conviction  And to accomplish both you need to afford defendants all the rights they need to mount a good defence -- a fair and speedy jury trial, access to good counsel, no excessive bail conditions, access to exculpatory evidence, the right against self-incrimination, the right to cross-examine witnesses, et cetera.  If we aren't sure that people who are punished are actually guilty, how do we uphold public trust in our political and legal institutions? As John Adams stated defending British soldiers in the Boston massacre:  These are still core tenets in Western jurisprudence and they are still as important now as they should have been in the 18th century. Blackstone's ratio is not about 'How much forensic technology do we have?', it's about 'How hard should we make it for the government to strip someone of his or her freedoms?' The answer is, 'Very'.  When we fail to respect these legal principles, you get cases where innocent people get fucked over by the police, by prosecutors, by the courts. [Or even by administrative tribunals at colleges and universities.](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-campus-rape-policy/538974/) A judgment is made, then the evidence is collected and cherry-picked, a rationalization made. History is littered with examples of men whose lives are ruined in one way or another because they have been falsely accused of sexual assault and/or murder. That's not right.  And don't forget that the victim is a young white blonde. If someone killed a nerdy, unattractive ethnic boy, no one would give a shit. But whenever a Stacy dies, everyone wants vengeance.  His sentence should be closer to 20 years plus lifetime probation, taking into account his age and psychological immaturity.	https://incels.is/threads/indiana-teen-murdered-pregnant-cheerleader-because-she-waited-too-long-for-abortion.169912/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_indiana_teen_murdered_pregnant_cheerleader_because_she_waited_too_long_for_abortion.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_indiana_teen_murdered_pregnant_cheerleader_because_she_waited_too_long_for_abortion.tsv	1578550163	News Indiana teen murdered pregnant cheerleader because she waited too long for abortion	34	1K	31

0	1578310573	PPEcel	Poll for shits and giggles. Here's the serious bit:  I'm doing a bit of research into due process at colleges and universities.  Let me give all of you some context. In 2011, at the behest of the Obama administration, the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights (OCR) published what is now commonly referred to as the 'Dear Colleague' letter. The 'Dear Colleague' letter required private and public academic institutions in the U.S. to institute a plethora of policies to combat 'sexual assault'.  The two policies that are of most interest to us included:  1. Administrative hearings should use a “preponderance of the evidence” standard to determine if a student is guilty of sexual assault. This means we need to only be 50.1% certain that someone is guilty in order to declare him guilty. This is a lower evidentiary bar than the 'clear and convincing' standard previously used, and far lower than the 'beyond a reasonable doubt' typically used in criminal law trials.  2. The alleged perpetrator is not allowed to directly or indirectly cross-examine the alleged victim, in order to prevent 'intimidation and trauma'.  Failure to abide by the OCR's new rules could result in the denial of federal funds to the offending institution -- research grants, government-backed student loans, et cetera. This effectively scared the daylights out of university administrators across the country.  We know based on incidents like the [Duke lacrosse rape case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_lacrosse_case) and [Rolling Stone's retracted University of Virginia story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Rape_on_Campus) that this is fueled by an unfounded, SJW-backed hysteria that foids are regularly victimized on campuses. Nevertheless, universities created sprawling bureaucracies simply to cater to the whims of every delusional, attention-seeking femoid.  Administrative proceedings may not have the force of a criminal conviction, but being publicly accused and expelled from a university for sexual assault is a career- and life-changing consequence. Now, untrained university administrators can effectively declare someone 'guilty' by nothing more than the vague hunch that 'he looks pretty guilty to me'. This is effectively the 'presumption of guilt' for ugly men, and they don't even have the right to question their accuser.  OCR's rules resulted in the expulsions of hundreds of innocent students (many of them [people of color](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2017/09/the-question-of-race-in-campus-sexual-assault-cases/539361/)), and in turn, hundreds of lawsuits filed by students whose due process rights were violated. Here's one court opinion written by a currycel judge (Amul Thapar) at the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. I've attached the full opinion below, but here is a third-party summary of the opinion:   Basically, the based Sixth Circuit shits on the University of Michigan for denying the male student the due process that he deserves. It was an immensely satisfying read.

The white woman said something to the effect of, 'False rape accusations aren't a big deal.'

0	1577059071	Edmund_Kemper	society's logic about sexual assault makes NO sense. people are all like:  if you get raped, you'll never heal and you'll forever be traumatized and live in eternal misery and horror (doesn't sound too ridiculous. but it gets more retarded.)  if you're a kid and someone simply touches your penis and walks away and you don't see them again, you'll forever be traumatized for life. having your penis touched when you're a kid is the most painful thing you can experience  if you're kissed on the lips against your will, you'll be forever traumatized for life  if you get groped, you'll never heal and forever will be traumatized  if you're a minor and have sex with someone older than you or date them, you'll be traumatized for life.  wtf. honestly. sure rape can be very painful, but the other ones? honestly i never understood how someone gets traumatized by having their genitals touched. if someone walks up to you, touches your penis and walks away, and you're a kid, how exactly can THAT traumatize you. the only reason why someone would be traumatized by that is because they're taught to be traumatized. it's called the nocebo effect. if they weren't taught to be traumatized by it, they wouldn't have been traumatized.  it's also interesting how in middle school, a friend of mine had some guy grab his hand and put the hand on another guy's penis. my friend probably wasn't traumatized. but i guess if they're all the same age it isn't traumatic. but i guess if the two guys my friend complained about were much older, he'd be traumatized? so it's only traumatic if they're older than you? how can that make sense? i remember Benji Madden from Good Charlotte got bullied in high school and one time the jocks smeared BENGAY with substance on his genitals. he was maybe 15-17 at the time. so if guys his age do that to him, it isn't traumatic but if a 40 year old does it to him, it's traumatic? And getting kissed on the lips against your will, people act like that's supposed to scar you? one time when i was 12, a guy (who was 13) kissed my lips against my will. it wasn't traumatic at all. it was uncomfortable yes but it wasn't traumatic. anyways i found out he wasn't actually gay or bisexual he was just a socially awkward guy who came from a kissy family. he didn't think what he did was gay. i saw him do other crazy things most people know are weird. he was actually straight, he even liked a girl in my class. what he did wasn't traumatic at all. it was very uncomfortable but wasn't traumatic. i moved on. in fact, when i hear his name, i don't even think about the kiss incident.  [A man named Paul Tappan](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sexual_Development_in_Childhood/bibbgdfPg3AC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=%22ruined+for+life%22+paul+tappan&pg=PA6&printsec=frontcover) (who is a sociologist) wrote about how sex attacks ruining people for life is a myth. he wrote how trauma from sex attacks usually come from the hysteria and reaction to the attack from society instead of the attack itself. Tappan believes 'rape, carnal abuse, defloration, incest, homosexuality (this was 1955) or indecent exposure' should only cause little lasting harm. The Kinsey researchers agreed with Tappan. A rape victim named [Charlotte Shane](https://thenewinquiry.com/live-through-this/) wrote an article about how she won't let her rapist's attack control her for the rest of her life and how it wasn't the worst thing to happen to her. she even said that rape doesn't effect women the same way as each other. some women are effect more severely or less severely is what she says. Fay Weldon also said rape isn't the worst thing to happen to a woman and she's a rape victim too. she faced backlash for what she said back in the late 90s.   Feminists didn't always view rape the way they do now. First wave feminists (late 1800s/early 1900s) believed women were resilient in the face of sexual violence instead of vulnerable. even in the 60s, feminists usually argued that rape is NOT the worst thing that can happen to a woman. then feminists started to say it is the worst thing to happen to a woman in the 70s with the anti-rape movement getting big.  the reason why sexual crimes, regardless of how severe they are, are seen as 'extremely' painful is because of society's historical interpretation of sex. since biblical times, sex has been viewed as degenerate and perverse and something that can only be done for reproduction. it wasn't supposed to be fun and anyone who did non-reproductive sexual stuff like anal sex, oral sex, masturbation or sex just for pleasure was seen as evil. also, society has viewed sex as the most intimate relationship one can have with someone else. therefore, society will believes taking this is the ultimate violation. this is what made sexual assault be seen as worse than any other crime. i don't see how making a crime 'sexual' makes it more traumatic. how is sexual supposed to be worse than any physical pain or physical violence? sure rape could be traumatic, but touching someone's penis, groping, statutory rape, etc. shouldn't be too painful. it should just be a brief moment of uncomfortable.   i also doubt that rape or child sexual abuse is something that ruins your life eternally. sure it can make your life much harder. sure you can go through a lot of nightmares and horrifying stuff, but i'm sure victims can still experience some joy in their life. i remember asking someone if they think Auschwitz survivors are able to enjoy life, they said Auschwitz survivors will struggle a lot in life but they still could have some happy days. so Auschwitz survivors, including those experimented on by Mengele, can enjoy life to an extent, but someone who was raped or had their penis touched can never feel joy again? Auschwitz was way worse than sexual abuse and rape. It's like society wants to tell us that the penis is so powerful that if we ever are forced to touch it, let alone have it inside us, it'll permanently destroy our souls. well there's nothing powerful about some piece of flesh between the legs. saying that there is power in a penis goes against the idea of empowering women. if rape is about power, like feminists often say, then why give them all that power by allowing what they did to torment you all your life?

40	1577070456	Ap0calypse	It’s a big deal for females; they see it like torture if a unattractive male tries to be sexual with them.  It’s just how they are wired. There’s no point in questioning it from outside their point of view.   There is a reason sexual assault against males isn’t taken seriously. A female sexually assaulting a male won’t trigger the the same disgust response a female feels when being sexually assaulted by a unattractive male.  One of my gay friends groped my crotch before without consent. I was disgusted by it, but it was lot less painful than being rejected by the opposite sex your whole life because of your genetics.	https://incels.is/threads/the-effects-of-sexual-assault-often-are-exaggerated.165984/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_the_effects_of_sexual_assault_often_are_exaggerated.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_the_effects_of_sexual_assault_often_are_exaggerated.tsv	1577059071	Serious the effects of sexual assault often are exaggerated.	68	1K	40

52	1576689361	Robtical	That makes her more of a dumb whore if she 'froze up' for dozens of minutes, just for not being able to handle the sight of 3 guys fighting. Brock was in the fight and he didn't freeze or look that bad in the mugshot after, so if she really froze for 30 minutes because of witnessing a fight then even toddlers are more mentally developed than her. I'm pretty sure they didn't spend the whole 30 minutes beating on him until the police arrived, or he'd be dead. At the time they started holding him down, the dumb whore should've started flapping her chad dick sucking lips to tell them she wasn't raped. If she was smart enough to lie to the paramedics like a lying piece of shit, then she would've not been too drunk to verbally intervene before they arrived. If your approval doesn't result in converting many cucked men into being anti-abortionists, then you almost did nothing to help them pass their anti-abortion laws. They treat a guy who grabbed a rostie's ass that was hanging out worse than murderers. So many men are trained from an early age by the cucked media and education system to see any kind of groping or sexual assault as a crime worse than anything else. Men need to break out of being brainwashed, and only expect an ass grab of a whore to result in a $50 fine if they're caught on camera. Foids who dress like whores are 100% whores. If they're slutty enough to put their ass and tits on display then they like the attention, or want money, or they're on the hunt for new chad dick, or else there would be no reason for them to dress that way. Unfortunately most cucked clubs in america are like this now, but it shouldn't be that way. Any foid dressed like a whore, especially in a club, should allow men to grab her ass. Sub6 Men need to stop giving slutty dressed foids tips with cash, and need to start sampling more ass. Because those cucked men get no benefit from funding a whore's lifestyle. They're not even good whores because they don't let you grab their asses after you tip them. Men should never tip waitress whores unless they let them feel on their ass and tits, if the whores are putting them on display then they should be ready for men to sample. Jfl at trying to use your sexuality to gain something by manipulation, then get upset when their sexuality is used by someone.  Men who aren't chads need to start hitting on whores and groping them more often. It's the only way they'll start to dress up and stop making excuses, or they'll start getting used to non-chad men hitting on them when they're dressed like sluts, which are both good outcomes. Men just need to stop being cucked and feel sorry for them every time they bitch about something. All men going to the gym will make foids more picky and only chase the new top 10% of men. The main ways to make foids humble and settle for their looksmatches are when the cucked laws are removed and men stop being cucks.	https://incels.is/threads/brock-turners-life-is-much-worse-than-chanel-millers-life.164854/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_brock_turners_life_is_much_worse_than_chanel_millers_life.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_brock_turners_life_is_much_worse_than_chanel_millers_life.tsv	1576605122	Serious Brock Turner’s life is much worse than Chanel Miller’s life	77	2K	52

0	1576648230	SniiperCel	Hey everyone. It's been a while. A lot has happened while I was gone and I'll get to it soon but today was very interesting.   Today all of the men on campus were gathered together for an 'assembly'. Apparently a group of foids got together and mass reported about 40 of us for sexual assault. Alpha basketball team coach shouted at us for about 40 minutes, bragging about how in his day he wanted to touch women too. Sadly I couldn't relate to him, and so I ignored most of what he said. I could care less about what alpha idiots have to say to me. I haven't touched a girl in over 5 years, not a hug, not a handshake, nothing. I barely managed to get looked at, most of the time that shit just happens when I'm speaking.   Alpha coach basically blackpilled everyone in the room. I found enjoyment watching all of the Chads and Tyrones holding their faces in their hands and borderline crying. He brought up fake allegations mostly, he told us that basically any foid can report you for even so much as a single touch on the shoulder, and you'll go to jail for it and end up on the sex offender's registry. Of course I knew this already. It's been over for us for a long time now, but seeing everyone else come to that realization was so satisfying. Watching all of the alphas slowly begin to lose their vigor brought a smile to my face.  Finally, they were seeing my world. Realizing that it's over. That no matter what you do, a foid will still have unlimited power over you. Foids control the world with their horrid roast beef vaginas. I have no pity for Chad, or Tyrone. I only want them to feel what I feel, the crippling despair of living in a world where you can't speak a single word, reach out for a even the smallest touch, without being ridiculed, violated, and have to watch your life be destroyed by a filthy foid. The second he mentioned female validation I could feel my blood boiling.   I can't stand foids. All of these normie imbeciles are fooled into liking pictures and commenting on foids' posts who will never speak to them. The Chads obviously won't suffer from this problem, they can have as much roast beef pussy as they'd like. It was fairly obvious who was incel and who wasn't in the room. We were straight-faced and calm, because we'd already been delivered that news, we came to these understandings on our own. We didn't need an alpha who fucks his wife and multiple other holes every day to tell us that it was over. We live that life every day. We know. The shadows of the disgusting vaginas that rule over us are where we will always slave, and no amount of preaching can change it.	https://incels.is/threads/its-over-for-men-in-2019-2020.164980/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_its_over_for_men_in_2019_2020.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_its_over_for_men_in_2019_2020.tsv	1576648230	Blackpill It's Over for Men in 2019-2020	3	437	0

42	1575988909	Mindmaxx	 What's interesting is how authoritarian impulses form the backbone of these types of movements. One foid right winger was literally arguing that the 'order' of society was more important than freedom, and that's why we need to ban porn. Their arguments are so transparently stupid, literally GW Bush tier, but they're blind to it because of ideological biases.  If porn is banned, it will lead to an increase in sexual assault. It'll also cause human trafficking to increase because of all the demand for bootleg porn. It might reduce some addiction, but that will probably be subsumed into other vices.  The fact is, people are coom addicts because they live in a society that's unhealthy. I remember an old study which 'proved' that rats inevitably become addicted to cocaine if it is available to them. This study was used as 'evidence' to fuel the war on drugs in the 70s. Well they re-did the study recently, providing the rats with a much nicer environment and healthy social opportunities. Guess what? The rats didn't touch the cocaine, even though it was freely available to them.  Conservatives always want to get rid of vices, without paying attention to why the vices are so out of control. They want to blame the invididual, without paying attention to the quality of the environment that the individual is forced to live in. I guess they would just rather power trip.	https://incels.is/threads/is-anyone-else-put-off-by-this-sudden-push-to-ban-porn.163468/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_is_anyone_else_put_off_by_this_sudden_push_to_ban_porn.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_is_anyone_else_put_off_by_this_sudden_push_to_ban_porn.tsv	1575968756	Discussion Is anyone else put off by this sudden push to ban porn?	78	3K	42

79	1575918306	Wizard32	Walking down a hallway will never feel as intimate as wiggling into a crawlspace friend, I think you are setting yourself up for disappointment.  Why? This is a normy attitude. I want fulfilling sex. For it to be fulfilling I need to keep my scruples.  If I put attaining sex (period) at all cost above my scruples (settled for un-fulfilling) I could've lost my virginity by committing crimes like soliciting a prostitute or engaging in sexual assault.  While some find fulfillment in either of these things, my belief in that a higher fulfillment is possible in being WANTED is what leads to the choice of celibacy.  This may not be a permanent state though. This likely means I just haven't fully embraced the blackpill, and still hold out unrealistic idealistic hopes.  IE if fulfilling sex will likely never come, may as well try out unfulfilling sex.  I think even though I consciously am accepting it, my subconscious mind is still an idealist and I want to keep my inner child alive and ignorant, and actually losing my virginity to a prostitute and feeling how unloved I am in that moment might shock him awake and thus to death.  No, if I do decide to escortcope in the future (which I would do out of curiosity for sex, not to 'stop being a virgin') it would be because I want to, not because i made a pact with some guy online.

43	1572909608	rubber-duckie	 I have 8 misconceptions surrounding inceldom.  This is the #2 misconception, here is an excerpt from the book:  _________________  2. “Incels believe they are entitled to sex.”  Nope – this is just an easy way to demonize incels for an overly simplistic interpretation of entitlement.  Incels are entitled to a sexual drive – just as any non-incel is.  But they are not out in public ordering women to drop their pants. Incels are just frustrated that women do not find them sexually attractive enough to want to sleep with them. This frustration expands far beyond the realm of sex. Overwhelmingly, incels just want a normal life, nothing special, just to be able to partake in dating, and intimacy, and love, and hopefully, have a family someday.  After years and years of rejection, unfortunately, many do not even see a strategy to activate a path to this basic life model.  The act of sex is an indispensable part of the intimacy that incels want, but it is still just one aspect of several. To cuddle; to kiss; to hold and be held; to look someone in the eyes and see that she wants to be with you: these features of a standard relationship are all part of the intimacy that incels desire. Of course, once that variety of affection and intimacy is established, sex often follows naturally.  If intimacy were a mountain, sex would just be the ice-covered peak – and incels do not just want to plant the flag on the summit they want to climb that whole fucking thing.  We need to stop pretending that, solitary “sex” (masturbation), is real sex. Digital pornography cannot mimic the expressiveness of an actual intimate sexual outing with a willing partner. This claim, alongside the claim that, “greater sexual access is no longer just the purview of the most attractive, the wealthiest, the most discreet, or the biggest risk-takers” are both patently absurd.   This is not a preference of lingo, it is just reality. Sex is sex. Sitting in your bedroom, lonely and dejected, binging nightly on digital pornography, while fantasizing about an actual companion who would never consider you as a romantic prospect is sad and depressing. Masturbating is not and should not be considered as a permanent, lifetime replacement for a real-life, willing partner.  Sure, masturbation has its benefits, but not when it is your only source of intimacy or sexual behavior. It is a substitute.[[ii]](https://incels.is/#_edn2) The reason why incels (and non-incels) want intimacy is quite simple - humans have both an instinctive drive to want sex, and a remarkably deep-seated need for being touched in a benign way. For incels, these very strict biological demands are remaining unfulfilled.  One incel confesses to other members of the online community:  “The only extended physical contact I've received in recent memory was when I had my annual mental breakdown a month or so back, and I was sitting there sobbing like a bitch, so my mother and father came over and just gave me a hug while I cried. For a little while afterwards it was like 30 years of this crushingly immense amount of pain and stress and anger was temporarily lifted off my shoulders for a few precious minutes. I can't even begin to imagine how much healthier and happier I'd be if I experienced that on a regular basis.”  It is strange how a public misunderstanding of incels created this illogical leap that sexless men - who desires intimacy, and who want to be physically or emotionally valued - would feel entitled to commit physical assault or rape. Not only are these acts reprehensible and illegal – they are acts that most incelibate men would be mentally, emotionally, and probably physically incapable of performing.  The rationality just is not there. Sexual assault and rape are the literal opposite of wanting to feel loved or desired. Conceptually, these are two inherently opposing and incompatible concepts. Wanting to feel desired or appreciated necessitates that someone places value into you, which means that no force or coercion of any kind can or should be involved.  Of course, desiring love, intimacy, and sex are natural – especially when those needs have been unmet for extended periods, if not your entire life. We must look at incels, in general, as people with extremely common and normal desires - not as would-be criminals wanting to commit heinous, abusive, and violent acts.  It is totally understandable to feel a sense of loss, regret, or even resentment for opportunities lost and needs left unfulfilled during arguably the prime years of one’s life (not just in terms of physicality but also circumstance). These are normal and reasonable feelings.  It is shocking to observe people who are in a position of privilege regarding attractiveness (we will later discuss how attractiveness empowers and privileges people in nearly every arena of life) could so carelessly and easily flaunt that advantage and use it as a tool to shame, vilify, and delegitimize unattractive men. At the very least, we should be able to expect some level of self-awareness and humility.  The precise reasons why incels cannot fulfill this need for intimacy varies on a case by case basis. And it is almost always a combination of varied factors.  The potential limiting factors are described in further detail in Chapter VII – What Women Find Attractive.  [ Regnerus, M. (2017).

0	1574770255	boojies	I try to avoid back to back posts in threads now, so instead of posting a new one in this background information thread [https://incels.is/threads/the-reaso...re-legit-but-not-in-2019.160247/#post-3378342](https://incels.is/threads/the-reasons-for-the-demonization-of-rape-are-legit-but-not-in-2019.160247/#post-3378342) I will simply make a new thread, seeing as the topic is dissociated enough from that thread as to warrant its own in any case.  I think caning and similar things are oftentimes superior punishments for rape than being locked up for decades or socially outcast. However, not necessarily forcing anyone to have that but just making it available as an option for them. I never raped or sexually assaulted at all, but feel that being severely beaten as a punishment would provide me equivalent deterrence as being locked up for quite some time, but be less of an inconvenience in many ways as well, and also less of an issue to the economy and general societal functioning. I think that is oftentimes more agreeable for everyone involved, even as many would see it as being barbaric I'm sure, and many others as not sufficient probably. Some people would likely develop masochism as a sort of defense to this punishment, or otherwise to put a pressure onto those intolerant of it by subjecting them to more disadvantageous alternatives by their immunity to it. I wonder if that is a sensible theory for the evolution of masochism. It predicts it would have arisen in a military setting most likely, as that was likely a punishment common in the military.  I think that is oftentimes fair, seeing as rape essentially constitutes violence against someone else, and theft from someone else, but can likely be made to be seen as just an unfortunate experience evolution caused females to endure, instead of as something requiring extensive time to psychologically recover from, especially as many females primarily suffer from the perceived harm to their reputations and the like, but that is more so a social issue causing that and corrected simply by reputation systems having this addressed in whichever internally valid way can be put forth as doing so, in the context of the group of neurotypicals, by putting things into the terms most dear to their moral sentiments and using valid social reasoning in their own materials to help them to understand, by taking their disintegrated thoughts that are to your perception incorrect, but working with the rules of their systems of such things toward forming in them the reason to modify their reputation system to minimize that effect of rape. This will be hardest to do in nations with strong Islam, but probably is quite feasibly in most of the western world.  With that social aspect of rape addressed it can likely oftentimes be made into what amounts to a violent assault, especially if it isn't itself also brought about by a violent assault especially, for otherwise it would be the same thing but twice done in my view. There is increased risk of things like pregnancy and disease spreading, but violent assaults carry a risk of death even if it isn't at all intended as a result of it, and more likely so than a rape that is minimally violent does. And I think it is fair as well to humiliate such people to a slight extent, but certainly nothing nearly as is the case currently, being more of a short term like effect than lasting for such hugely extended periods of time. I find it very interesting now that I think of it, how masochism is essentially an evolved resistance to these two classes of punishment, of violent force and social reputation damage.             I also like having it be similar to DUI, which is actually quite dangerous and rightfully even more prohibited than it is, and far less validly socially acceptable than it is, where there are oftentimes rapidly escalating penalties starting rather lower but rapidly moving upwards, which seems fair to me given the relatively common nature of males raping or sexually assaulting, but still having some stronger discouragement for people egregiously or continuously ignoring such things, especially if any have developed masochism and rendered such things ineffective against them, seeing as I don't think people ought to be beaten to death to be made to suffer instead of have orgasms.  Using such corporal types of punishments also allows for them to be issued more rapidly, which is beneficial for everyone, seeing as it will decrease prevalence of raping the most as it is primarily the risk of punishment and not the severity of punishment that acts as a deterrent. Increasing risk of punishment and decreasing severity of punishment is both more just and effective from a criminological perspective. With such rape kit backlog it takes so long to process investigations that many people are never apprehended for ages even after being known to have raped, and will have substantial anxiety as well prior to being arrested, which is not even at all considered in terms of a persons punishment for crime, but can be substantially severe, and it is more fair to have everyone violating such laws punished with high probability but not particularly severely, which is with great success accomplished with such rapidly issued punishments.  Can probably reduce sadists risks of offending by letting them issue such things as well, which gives even those having desire for sadism expression with unwilling victims an outlet that can be socially approved of while it remains effective from masochists anyway. Even males with desire to rape females can probably get some relief from such a desire by beating adolescent male rapists as their punishments, which is still more agreeable for them than being brought through programs in many cases, and perhaps effective, but I suppose research ought be done on that matter as all others, seeing as the scientometric system is best adhered to in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence according to its scientometrics; as opposed to any given person having any say regarding any matter, for people say nonsense about those things they know nothing, and yet imagine themselves as knowing something, whereas the scientometric system is the only rational thing to have trust in, even as it is not without failures and must be protected as our most precious asset, even if the botnet zombies are taught their reputation systems, as they ought to be, and long live the botnet masters, and thank you for your fantastic work at balancing such things. I am so sorry for my calls for your death and such. I am very glad that it was you who brainwashed the government and seized control of the nation, seeing as I am sure you know who I am and yet have not yet killed me. May you long live in prosperity and trust in the most honest of intent of validity in my integration of you to the truth of actual reality as it exists according to our most precious asset of least failure in providing to us such revelations regarding the way of our existence.  Also, I think females can of course have a say in the matter, particularly in terms of case by case inputs from them, or otherwise from them as an anonymous group in the event of a rapist in a social or not more stranger like relationship with the female in question, to avoid unfairness by their relationship. However, I also like the previously unconstitutional University based systems, and am glad that the courts have been brainwashed into allowing this unconstitutional structure to stand nevertheless, for I find it to be particularly fairly used especially in providing a further way to increase the rate at which rape kits are processed and result in a equal dispersion of punishment by being able to faster process things, and also in providing typically substantially lesser and scholastic/career oriented punishments of slightly slowing down the progress of people, particularly useful for people who are not more beneficial by not being slowed down in such a way in terms of contributions of significance they can provide, which is merit based exceptionalism and not fair per se, but utilitarian and for the greater good nevertheless, so seemingly an agreeable exception for diverse perspectives.  Also, substitution theory has been scientifically established, and is foolish to not adhere to. The Sex Cult is in fact an establishment of religion, and one of the various themed fantasy worlds that the hypnotists must immediately cause to take a new form. Pornography of rape is valuable for reducing sexual victimization, and must be rendered legally accessible, as must sexual alternatives to raping such as regulated prostitution, which additionally reduces disease burden. Married women already receive governmental tax breaks for their married condition, and are thereby compensated for the disadvantage they suffer by their husbands' use of satellite whores, and adultery is typically grounds for a divorce in most religious systems in any case, with married females typically coming out ahead in such situations anyway, and that seems proper as it also impacts the husband negatively by such reputation system based neurotypical groupings.  I think most rapists and sexual assault behaviorists would likely be substantially deterred by such corporal punishments, at least for the foreseeable future until widespread masochism may render it useless. And also that most rapists would nevertheless prefer such a punishment, making it seemingly ideal to me when considering all the other things I said as well.	https://incels.is/threads/extending-a-bit-on-the-rape-demonization-thread-and-introducing-corporal-punishment.160472/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/extending_a_bit_on_the_rape_demonization_thread_and_introducing_corporal_punishment.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/extending_a_bit_on_the_rape_demonization_thread_and_introducing_corporal_punishment.tsv	1574770255	extending a bit on the rape demonization thread and introducing corporal punishment	4	489	0

Most incels if not all have been cast aside and bullied to a oblivion throughout their childhood. Verbally, physically and mentally abused for years on end, week in week out.  Then you get older, you probably express it to people, they tell you to 'man up, grow up' etc, 'You're 25 now, it's in the past, time to move on'. Wa-wa-wa-wait, hold the fucking phone retard.   A female gets slightly brushed up against, it's sexual assault, if a woman gets called a whore, it's abuse not a fact. And when a woman is 'bullied' it's spoken about. Why don't us incels go beat the fucking shit out of these females then? OH NO, YOU CAN'T DO THAT! Why not? We were beaten up, abused and not helped for years as a child. Now we get told to 'grow up and move on' whilst you as an adult get some 'harsh words' said to you.

9	1574739212	boojies	I think that it shouldn't be demonized. A large percentage of males want to rape, so one who does shouldn't be imagined as deviant or using a sexually unnatural method, even if you yourself are one of the also substantial number of males not with any significant arousal to rape. You should also realize that you will be much more likely to rape in the event that the opportunity presents itself to you than you will imagine yourself as being without such opportunity present, as one can ascertain simply by looking at the history of war rape and statements of many of the soldier participants indicating their surprise at acting differently than they imagined they would.     A common sentiment among such people, who I certainly don't hold any particular animosity toward, even as not thinking females ought to be raped either. I like rape themes to fantasy and have desire for rape, as is common:    Indicates that the majority of males -- at least from a sample of students at university -- fantasize about sexual assault behaviors, with perhaps a little less than a quarter of them having manifested sexual assault behaviors. Certainly one simply cannot demonize nearly a quarter of males, and presuming even that only some of such males are arrested it is certainly not at all just to demonize a small subset of people for what a much larger group is doing without trouble ever befalling them.  Part of the issue is that the radical feminists both condemn things like pornography use and prostitution, all the while complaining about rape. They are similar to creationists in that they reference a false reality regarding matters of sex and simply deactivate their logical and rational brain networks in response to the matter. So-called feminist theory is more properly considered something analogous to religion than a valid science, and is by and large a laughable abomination, having little valid presence in a scholarly setting. It denies and competes with established sciences like evolutionary biology, and this renders it as comparable to teaching creation science.        Such feminists who are against prostitution, against pornography, and so on, are extreme expressions of guarder female phenotype. They compete with satellite females who drain the economic resources of their partners by having morality campaigns against the abominable whores and throwing them into church indoctrination centers.     This works to your detriment as satellite males, for you use such methodologies as fucking prostitutes and jacking off to pornography yourselves oftentimes. Guarder males are less likely to do these things because of being so reputation oriented. One of your primary sexual enemies is the guarder females, for unless you are one of the rarer fitter satellite males, already being part of the much rarer satellite male group, they aren't going to have interest in mating with you unless you use mimicry most likely to signal being a fitter satellite male or guarder male, for guarders tend to do better, and guarder females will guard higher quality mates from you in the process of guarding their guarded mates from them, for they use the legal system and fits of moral outrage to actuate their sexual strategies.  However, I also have sympathy for females, and feel that primarily rape should be addressed by having prostitution, pornography, and other substitutes for sex, with such things also having no stigma attached to them to the extent that can be done. There will still be some rape left, and I still will not be particularly condemning of such massively grey shaded behaviors, to a good degree of into darker shades of such even. Still, I aim to avoid such things and have success in doing so without having any failure regarding such matters, and although I am against having egregious penalties for such things that aren't progressed egregiously into darker shades toward black -- and certainly am against pretending as if such behaviors are even manifestations of particular deviance -- I certainly can't imagine supporting the actual legalization or decriminalization of the rape of any class of people.	https://incels.is/threads/the-reasons-for-the-demonization-of-rape-are-legit-but-not-in-2019.160247/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/the_reasons_for_the_demonization_of_rape_are_legit_but_not_in_2019.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/the_reasons_for_the_demonization_of_rape_are_legit_but_not_in_2019.tsv	1574684588	The reasons for the demonization of rape are legit, but not in 2019	9	771	9

15	1573720861	Pai Mei	After some careful thought, I'd have to say that strict liability laws when it comes to statutory rape/statutory sexual assault is the biggest form of white-knighting in Western law. Even in circumstances where there is irrefutable proof of deception on the part of the plaintiff, in the majority of cases there is literally no legal defense. In most jurisdictions, all a prosecutor has to prove is a complainant's age and that there were sexual relations with the defendant, and that will suffice for a conviction.  Disclaimer: no, I am not into loli's/pedo shit and I don't condone/advocate sexual relations with minors.	https://incels.is/threads/are-rape-laws-actually-the-biggest-form-of-white-knighting-ever.157579/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_are_rape_laws_actually_the_biggest_form_of_white_knighting_ever.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_are_rape_laws_actually_the_biggest_form_of_white_knighting_ever.tsv	1573715769	Discussion Are rape laws actually the biggest form of white-knighting?

All of us can find a passed out girl that has been drinking too much and have sexual relations with her. Unfortunately, I live nowhere near a club or night scene life thus I cannot find passed out girls near me. My cousin used to live near the beach and he said he would find passed out drunk chicks all the time face down in sand and half naked.

My fellow kikes created a near-perfect racket. Don't be stupid and don't fall for it. Therapy fixes nothing and in most cases makes things worse.

0	1572125505	Weston404	[11] We disagree. In our view, the arbitrator’s decision under the second element of the William Scott test is unreasonable. In the arbitrator’s analysis of the contextual factors, she characterized what occurred as “lower end sexual harassment,” downplaying the seriousness of the misconduct. There can be no doubt that the grabbing and squeezing of another’s breast without consent is sexual assault. Sexual assault, by its very definition, is serious misconduct. Further, the arbitrator did not appropriately consider the employer’s position regarding safety in the workplace and the grievor’s dishonesty. Instead, the arbitrator focused on the circumstances of the grievor and irrelevant considerations, noting, for example, that the complainant did not appear to be traumatized in any significant way. This was not a proper analysis of the factors before her. 	https://incels.is/threads/feminists-contend-that-breasts-are-not-sexual-yet-touching-breasts-is-a-sex-crime.153525/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_feminists_contend_that_breasts_are_not_sexual_yet_touching_breasts_is_a_sex_crime.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_feminists_contend_that_breasts_are_not_sexual_yet_touching_breasts_is_a_sex_crime.tsv	1572125505	Blackpill Feminists contend that 'breasts are not sexual', yet touching breasts is a sex crime!	13	660	0

(iStock) Toronto police have charged a 62-year-old man with two counts of sexual assault following separate alleged incidents on public buses. Investigators say the incidents happened on the afternoons of Sept. 17 and Oct. 8. In the first case, police were called to Sheppard West subway station around 2 p.m., after a man allegedly sat down beside a woman on a TTC bus, ignoring other empty seats, and sexually assaulted her. Officers say the woman told the bus driver, who called police. In the second case, police were called to Jane subway station around 2:25 p.m., after a man allegedly sexually assaulted a 24-year-old woman. In that case, they say, the man also sat down next to the victim on a TTC bus. The woman fled the bus and the man stayed on board, police say. The accused appeared in court Friday morning. Anyone with information is asked to contact police at 416-808-3100 or leave an anonymous tip with Crime Stoppers by calling 416-222-TIPS (8477).

Tommy Lee Jenkins, 32, is now facing charges of using a computer to attempt to persuade, induce or entice a minor to engage in unlawful sexual activity after authorities say he traveled on foot from Whitestown, Indiana, to Neenah, Wisconsin, to have sex with a teen he met online, according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney’s Office.  According to authorities, Jenkins began exchanging instant messages with “Kylee”— who he believed was a 14-year-old girl living with her mother — on Oct. 1.  'do u care im 14 and drink?' the 'teen' asked Jenkins in one of their initial interactions, according to court records.  Jenkins replied that he didn't, before later suggesting the 'teen' should come visit him in Indiana.   'If i had the money I would bring you up we're I am at right now and I would so you know how a dad should be to you,' he allegedly wrote according to the records. But the conversation soon turned X-rated as Jenkins allegedly asked the 'teen' whether she had had sex, which 'port' she had used and said he would check her private area when she arrived to make sure she was ok.   Jenkins also allegedly repeatedly asked her to send sexually explicit photos of herself, and told 'Kylee' he wanted to have sex with her.  'we will have sex soon as you get here and u will not what to stop at all and u will not have no close on,' he allegedly said during the exchange.  When she refused to travel to Indiana to have sex with him, Jenkins began the 351-mile trek to Wisconsin on foot, updating her of his progress along the way in sexually explicit conversations he continued to have with the “teen,” prosecutors say. Jenkins allegedly sent “Kylee” selfies of himself and photos of landmarks, including churches and exit signs, throughout his trek, according to a federal criminal complaint obtained by The Indianapolis Star.  He told “Kylee” he wanted to have 500 children with her, including one within a year, court documents said.  On Thursday, he told “Kylee” he had made it to Milwaukee and that someone had bought him a bus ticket to the teen’s house.  But when he arrived in Winnebago County, he discovered that “Kylee” was really a Winnebago County Sheriff’s deputy working with the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force. He was arrested by sheriff’s deputies and the FBI.  If convicted, Jenkins faces a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years to life in prison, prosecutors said.  It is not Jenkin’s first brush with the law. In 2011, he was charged with two counts of repeated-first degree sexual assault of a young boy. He was sentenced the following year to four years of probation after the charges were reduced to four counts of child abuse, the Oshkosh Northwestern reports.	https://incels.is/threads/norwoodcel-walks-350-miles-for-jb.150939/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_norwoodcel_walks_350_miles_for_jb.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_norwoodcel_walks_350_miles_for_jb.tsv	1571071554	JFL Norwoodcel Walks 350 miles for jb	28	2K	0

Getting to tap into women as a labor resource and their resulting expenditure as the sex that statistically spends the most, is a decent tradeoff as far as society is concerned with respect to incel mass shootings and male on female violence as a whole. When you think about it, you only lose a few dozen lives every few months but you are making billions more by allowing women all the provisions that a modern secular society can offer  You'll see a bunch of what I call fake outrage on news, television, media, etc, but when you look at our decisions AS A COLLECTIVE, it is quite obvious WE ARE ALL PRETTY MUCH ALRIGHT WITH THE WAY THINGS ARE (well the majority), and were more outraged at the the people committing the acts, than focused on preventing people from wanting to commit said acts  IF SOCIETY WASN'T INHERENTLY SELFISH, IT WOULD BE FOCUSED ON STOPPING 'EVIL' AT ITS ROOT (LACK OF SATISFACTION & COMFORT IN LIFE)	https://incels.is/threads/society-doesnt-detest-harmful-acts-and-tragedies-society-detests-peoples-ability-to-concieve-of-said-acts-commit-them.151058/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_society_doesnt_detest_harmful_acts_and_tragedies_society_detests_peoples_ability_to_concie.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_society_doesnt_detest_harmful_acts_and_tragedies_society_detests_peoples_ability_to_concie.tsv	1571100355	Blackpill Society Doesn't Detest Harmful Acts And Tragedies, Society Detests People's Ability To Concieve Of Said Acts & Commit Them	11	597	0

0	1566950410	BlkPillPres	I find it weird how society doesn't understand this, men have a dual role, both very important  One role is for stabilizing an already existing status quo and the other is the 'revolutionary' role that destabilizes the status quo when change is necessary, its all cause and effect  Men take on the 'stabilizer role' when a reasonable social contract is in place and being adhered to  Men take on the 'destabilizer role' when the social contract is no longer reasonable or no longer being adhered to  Its basically an 'amoebic response' as similar changes and actions take place among the male collective without men having to communicate, its like a hive mind in a sense, since 'male goals' are similar and usually aligned, the 'male response' will reflect this and also be similar  This is why its not confusing (to the black pilled) that male violence, suicide, etc has increased in these times, its pretty much an expected response, and it won't stop, it will only get worse, most all men are pretty much gone into 'fuck society' mode, and the masses of men that aren't are being kept in line via propaganda and false hope (indoctrination), it won't last though, men are catching on  Feminism has destroyed the role of the 'stabilizer' (protector & provider) by making it no longer a viable path, which is why it confuses me why people are always saying:  'Where are all these mass shooters coming from' 'Why is crime on the rise' 'Why are so many men committing suicide' Etc  Men are just falling into the roles that they are left with  I myself used to have an aversion to violence and crime, but over the years I've realized that criminals were right, criminals were just black pilled earlier about how the world works than the average person  If you painted the picture of the world I see now to 10 year old me, I'd probably be somebody's 'weed guy' right now selling weed on some block or maybe even a harder drug, because its ridiculous to think that society expects men to, wake up, work hard and slave away to make some other guy rich (indefinitely), do all the degrading shit, just to settle for used goods and probably raise children that aren't even yours  The social contract between men and society has been violated, so more and more men are waking up, more and more men are becoming nihilistic, they may never reach as extreme a level of nihilism as I, but they'll be more 'empty' of a person than they would have been in a world worth living for, a society worth working hard for  As time goes on you are ironically going to see domestic abuse go up, sexual assault, rape go up, general criminality go up, child abuse and sexual assault go up, terrorism and anarchism go up, etc in response to feminism which is supposed to help curb/stop these things. Since men are being pushed out of their rightful role and replaced by the government, replaced by a societal collective, men's actions will reflect one lashing out against its enemy, lashing out against society itself, its only natural  There is literally nothing society can do to stop this, because more and more men are being pushed into the bracket of 'unwanted' and 'undesirable', that's the funny part of it all, women don't think their actions through, if they just held back a little, at least a good portion of men would be unaffected by hypergamy and would side with women and remain docile and complacent, but so many men, even average men are being fucked by hypergamy, its only going to take a little push to send things over the cliff  I have pretty much made it my goal in life to destroy as much as possible and to deprive as much as possible from society, I will even use every tax loophole I can	https://incels.is/threads/if-men-cant-be-protectors-providers-theyll-be-destroyers-deprivers.140942/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_if_men_cant_be_protectors_providers_theyll_be_destroyers_deprivers.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_if_men_cant_be_protectors_providers_theyll_be_destroyers_deprivers.tsv	1566950410	Blackpill If Men Can't Be Protectors & Providers, They'll Be Destroyers & Deprivers	41	2K	0

A dyed-haired female SJW game developer asks to collaborate nu-male on a new project. Nu-male is afraid she will accuse him of sexual assault, but the SJW game developer argues if she did that, their game would fail and neither of them would be able to find new partners to collaborate with. Nu-male considers this argument sensible and agrees to collaborate. They begin work, but at some point after the project is finished SJW game developer accuses Nu-male of sexual assault, tarnishing them both. The dying Nu-male asks SJW game developer why she accused him of sexual assault, to which she replied 'I couldn't help it. Its in my nature.'   SJW game developer then has a vice documentary made about her and gets $2000 per month of victimbux from other numales on patreon. 	https://incels.is/threads/obese-kick-starter-scammer-zoe-quinn-accuses-game-dev-of-abuse-his-family-and-friends-dump-him-in-less-than-2-days-then-he-ropes.142102/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/obese_kick_starter_scammer_zoe_quinn_accuses_game_dev_of_abuse_his_family_and_friends_dump_him_in_le.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/obese_kick_starter_scammer_zoe_quinn_accuses_game_dev_of_abuse_his_family_and_friends_dump_him_in_le.tsv	1567417432	"obese kick starter scammer Zoe Quinn accuses game dev of ""abuse"".

Taxes also go to funding 'domestic violence' shelters that don't allow in straight men, and their only real purpose is to give homeless foids free housing, that's why most of the homeless people on the street are men, cucked laws even make it harder for men to work because affirmative action and beta managers make it so foids always get hired over sub6 men for the best jobs. If sub6 men all stopped paying taxes none of this cucked shit would be possible.

0	1564926742	LordRatcel	   • The top 20% of men see 80% of women attractive. • The top 80% of women see only 20% of men attractive. • 4/20 = 1/5 = 20% • This means that women are 80% more likely to be raped than men and while considering that the male population is on average a higher than the female population you can really start to see a HUGE imbalance of sexual assault. So I’m going to believe there’s 2 possibilities for this.. 1. Maybe it’s because men on average are more psychopathic and are less willing to ask for consent and that the reason women are raped more often is because women are just generally socially and emotionally oppressed and are afraid to say no. Maybe their sex drive is far lower than men’s sex drive and they are simply raped by sexually frustrated men, including good-looking men. And the reason less men are raped is because they are physically more dominant, are able to say no and women are the ‘empathetic’ gender. 2. In reality men find women on average 75% more attractive than women do so the chances of a female rejecting a man based on biology alone is much more probable. Women have much higher standards than men and are only truly attracted to a mate carrying the highest value sperm (top 20% of men). If a man is low value than their genetics do not deserve to be validated.  So I truly believe the second one is the true reason women are raped more often, it’s just women having to have sex with a man they don’t find attractive. A grown woman being raped by a grown man is not as horrific and evil as people have been socially programmed to believe, is cheating your genetics really that bad? Perhaps makeup and plastic surgery are just as evil as rape, because they’re both ways people cheat their ways to pleasure	https://incels.is/threads/most-rape-sexual-assault-statistics-prove-the-80-20-rule.136120/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_most_rapesexual_assault_statistics_prove_the_8020_rule.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_most_rapesexual_assault_statistics_prove_the_8020_rule.tsv	1564926742	Blackpill Most rape/sexual assault Statistics prove the 80/20 rule..	3	438	0

Dating was easy, the only thing you needed was probably a job, any job, and a car.  Today the standards of the average female are completely crazy, completely out of touch with reality, they only want the top 1% of men.  Our parents are completely out of touch with reality. Back in their day a guy just needed to straight walk up to any girl in the street, in broad daylight, and ask her out.  The babe would say 'sure, there is a dinner/cafe close by, let's grab something to eat, wink*' or 'no, thank you' and go on with her business no scandal and no bitch reaction, just the good old 'yes or no'.

Now we all know females love to make up false rape cases and ruin mens lives, and the amount of false rape cases outnumber the amount of rapes,( but thats another story) so its not suprising females love to miscontrue and spew bullshit about being raped when it really wasnt rape.  Ill give you an example of many, i cbf linking it because it was a few weeks ago and cant find it, but the story will help me differentiate between what rape and sexual assault is.  There was a story about a female and her boyfriend (now ex, teehee) having sex (teehee). They both CONSENTED, and were doing the deed until the female decided that he was going too 'rough' and she wanted him to stop. He wouldnt stop and was hurting her. in her reddit post, guess what she claimed it as? RAPE. That is not RAPE, that is sexual assault as the sex was consented between both parties until something bad happened.  Now, lets say if the female was walking along a public street or something and a random guy got out of the car and dragged her into the car took her somewhere and fucked her against her will, no consent, then YES, that is RAPE.	https://incels.is/threads/we-live-in-a-society-where-normies-have-been-brainwashed-and-still-dont-understand-the-difference-between-sexual-assault-and-rape.129029/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_we_live_in_a_society_where_normies_have_been_brainwashed_and_still_dont_understand_the_diffe.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_we_live_in_a_society_where_normies_have_been_brainwashed_and_still_dont_understand_the_diffe.tsv	1561950668	Serious We live in a society where normies have been brainwashed and still dont understand the difference between sexual assault and rape	13	560	0

48	1560978548	Invalidusername	  what's the difference between a depressed blackpiller and a depressed bluepiller? Their way of thinking is different, but either way they're still both depressed. Their beliefs didn't magically alter their brains.  Same way here, how someone may be both blackpilled but still crave validation due to loneliness. By merely acknowledging the blackpill, you're not going to alter the chemistry of your brain and your psychological state.  I didn't argue against the blackpill in my response, rather I stated that it doesn't make anyone bluepilled for feeling lonely since loneliness is influenced by a variety of factors that can coincide with the belief of the blackpill.  I mean, it's been proven that loneliness can have links to depression and low self esteem which makes sense in the case of incels seeing, because of their looks, incels weren't validated/approved/accepted by their peers. This all can lead to isolation n shit which is very detrimental towards one health and well-being.  Also, it's been proven that loneliness can be very damaging to one's physical and mental health. Physical risks can be higher levels of stress, increased risk of developing a disability, heart disease, being more vulnerable to chronic illnesses and etc.  All of this doesn't fade away because of the blackpill, it can still very well effect you.   change what exactly? you can't change your looks unless you undergo surgery.  you can find ways to cope with loneliness, depression and whatnot but it ultimately doesn't cure it (tbf, this depends on the individual and the severity of their mental state). would actively trying to fight against it be recommended? yes, but there isn't a guarantee that it'll be cured. this issue isn't black and white, it's quite grey.   Incels complaining about hypergamy usually stems from their frustration and venting. Whether an incel uses appeal to nature or not, it doesn't stop him from complaining about hypergamy because he's being affected by it.  Someone can hate a lion for eating an innocent gizelle, and still use appeal to nature because they could simply hate how things are like.    Society implementing rules and restrictions and social norms plays a role in how someone ACTS. For example, let's say a sexually frustrated man with 0 legal access of sex feels a really strong desire to satiate his desire. What's stopping him from raping someone (excluding morals and other factors)? The rules that society implements (jail for sexual assault) prevents such a man from doing such an act.  Does this get rid of his urges and desires? Nope, it just limits the way he acts.  I guess you can argue that social conditioning could be a factor, but then again this issue isn't a black and white issue: it's quite grey. In other words, it doesn't apply for all bc it can vary.   Choice can be limited by various factors. The reasons why normies are generally more outgoing and stable is due to the validation, approval and acceptance of their normie peers that allows them to be mentally stable.  If anything, it's an example of just world fallacy to believe that an incel has as much of a choice and opportunity as a normie once you consider his current conditions, mental state, physical condition and etc.   Without social norms, rules and regulations a foid is motivated purely by hedonism. By implementing these factors, it doesn't stop what the foid may desire but rather it limits their actions or even keeps them away from performing unwanted actions.   don't think I argued against this point, but still it's an interesting piece of information.   Again, this issue isn't black and white at times. Depending on various factors, one doesn't simply stop feeling lonely or stop caring about companionship.  How would you suggest someone stops feeling and caring about any of those? Especially considering the real affects of loneliness as I've already stated.   Again its not black and white, it's contingent. A clinically depressed person has a good chance of not curing their depression, but they can attempt to cure it.   Again, not black and white etc etc.   I don't recall arguing against this   ded srs	https://incels.is/threads/what-do-you-want-more-a-girlfriend-who-loves-you-or-just-plain-sex.126894/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/experiment_what_do_you_want_more_a_girlfriend_who_loves_you_or_just_plain_sex.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/experiment_what_do_you_want_more_a_girlfriend_who_loves_you_or_just_plain_sex.tsv	1560900141	Experiment What do you want more, a girlfriend who loves you or just plain sex?	56	1K	48

14	1560700600	Guest2	They will say this makes men 'misogynistic' and that 'as long as they have nothing to hide then they're fine' but the perception of women saying the same thing is so different. Can you imagine the response if it was revealed that '60% of female managers are uncomfortable with being alone with males for fear of rape'? They would not be reprimanded for supporting misandry and calling men rapists; they would have yet more support in making them feel less threatened.   Becausese that's all it is in the end; women rely on emotion more than men, but that's another topic for another day. Anyway, back to the point.  What's more wrong with men feeling uncomfortable because of the power given to a woman with uncertain intentions (untrue allegations/tainted reputation etc) than a woman feeling uncomfortable alone with a man because of the power he is given (potential rape or sexual assault)? Is the dynamic so different? However, while women in the workplace are given support and sympathy, men's arguements are invalidated by social pressure to be professional and not to whine, and the increasing censorship of mainstream media platforms making it nigh impossible to speak about men's issues without being called a misogynist or another buzzword.	https://incels.is/threads/male-managers-realize-women-in-the-management-are-a-problem-feminism-is-destroying-itself.126491/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/lifefuel_male_managers_realize_women_in_the_management_are_a_problem_feminism_is_destroying_itself.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/lifefuel_male_managers_realize_women_in_the_management_are_a_problem_feminism_is_destroying_itself.tsv	1560690264	LifeFuel Male managers realize women in the management are a problem.

I just asked you to prove claims such as this one:   Don't back pedal here you literally used an appeal to tradition ''Second of all, back when only men had any say, it was legal to marry girls of just about any age, provided her father agreed to the marriage. Age of Consent did not exist.'' your quotes not mine you were trying to prove this as somehow proving age of consent don't exist but it does.   I did not appeal to tradition at any point.   Like btfo you literally just used an appeal to tradition when you say back when that is is a appeal to tradition if you trying to prove something is right.  Lmao. You're worse than some of the leftist cucks in this regard    Dude lmao you do realize ultimately the thing's that causes foid's to fuck chad's is younger lust right ?????? older women have even lower libido so their's less to worry about their are also shit like societal pressures to help enforce this so less women will ultimately fuck chad's women follow rules much more so than men you are bluepilled if you think that is a lie look at history even the declaration of female right's was signed by men women would fall in place in a heart beat it's better for the man aswell cause he is more emotionally mature and overall it increases human happiness think about it for a sec dude a women as soon as she turn's 25 cause of societial pressures is more likely to settle down later on most women whore around in the their primes most women peak at 16/17 just saying so ultiamtely it would help men.  So you're saying the goverment is cracking down on abuse rings. You've agreed that no legislation is being pushed to legalize young relationships. How does that support your argument again?   No you fucking moron i said their increasing it implicitly i never said their was legislation or their cracking down on it cause their's not in fact if anything they leave a blind eye to it what i am saying is ultimately it increases it's profit's they do this with drug trafficking as well [https://www.thenewamerican.com/worl...d-top-mexican-drug-cartel-exposed-as-partners](https://www.thenewamerican.com/world-news/north-america/item/17396-u-s-government-and-top-mexican-drug-cartel-exposed-as-partners) this argument boil's down to just cause the goverment doesn't out right say it doesn't mean their not encouraging like gtfo dude their doing it implicitly to increase it and they know this big brother isn't stupid they can see what's going on i mean is hitler any less responsible for the death of the jew's cause he didn't kill 6 million jew's or stalin or any dictator you implicilty support something and also big brother want's to atleast appear popular with the populace so they pass certain law's to crack down on pedophilia this is one of the rear cases where they play morality but in reality they will use the profit's made by these bastard's to strong arm it's ownself.  AoC = age of consent   Oh well never mind then i retract that statement their is a age of consent just cause the line becomes ambiguous near the older ages doesn't mean the gap doesn't exist.

0	1557673477	BlkPillPres	The reason why women are so triggered by rape in media today, or any indication of sexual assault on a woman, is because it pulls them out of the illusion modern society creates for them, it is reality check, and we all know how much women hate reality  Rape as a concept, destroys the illusion of 'female power' and reminds women that they have none, all power they have is by proxy, all safety they have is created by and facilitated by men  A great example of this was the Tomb Raider game that had a rape scene: [https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-creators-are-no-longer-referring-to-games-a-453100845](https://kotaku.com/tomb-raider-creators-are-no-longer-referring-to-games-a-453100845)  Lara Croft is a 'female power' icon that many women likely live vicariously through, and to have her even be a victim of attempted sexual assault pulls them out of the fantasy and absolutely triggers them, because they are snapped right back to a reality where they are just a potential victim, they are a woman again in the truest sense, a being whose entire existence revolves around being acted upon, like an object, and society can prop up as many laws and social norms and values, etc as it wants, at the end of the day, that is all being a woman is ever really going to amount to  You can show me the richest, most powerful woman in the world, and even she has to get down on her knees and suck some guys dick (assuming she's straight), being submissive, weak, vulnerable, etc is inherent to existence as a woman, and it disturbs them whenever media, of which purpose is escapism, reminds them of their place in the world, their standing as an individual, their worth as a person, which is only ever realized through their sexuality  THIS REMINDS ME OF ANOTHER THREAD I MADE - [https://incels.is/threads/women-are-ashamed-of-their-existence-and-for-good-reason.98407/](https://incels.is/threads/women-are-ashamed-of-their-existence-and-for-good-reason.98407/)  Women aren't really an introspective bunch so I'm sure a lot of them get extremely triggered (more than most women) and they don't even know why, I can think of one kind of woman who will be most the most triggered by rape: THE CAREER WOMAN.  She's intelligent, she went to prestigious schools, maybe was at the top of her class, maybe graduated with honors, climbed her way up the career ladder, and now she has many men working beneath her, maybe she's even a CEO, she gets off on it in ways she doesn't even realize, or maybe she's a hardcore feminist and she's conscious of why she gets off on it, she likes the idea of the reversal of the power dynamic, she has all these male lackeys beneath her that she gives menial tasks to, condescends to, maybe even cock teases a bit because she gets off on getting him flustered knowing full well she would never give him the chance.  Society is set up in such a way where women can do shit like this, and fear no consequences. But lets say her favorite lackey to fuck with is Bob, middle aged, 4/10, balding white guy, typical hardworking office guy Bob. She's going to be joking about Bob with her boyfriend/husband, with her girlfriends and other women who have climbed the ladder with her, etc. Then one day she stumbles upon a depiction of rape, be it in a game, movie, music, etc, and in that instant her entire world momentarily falls apart and she is broken, because she realizes that one day Bob, that guy who is so beneath her financially, physically, mentally, etc, could just snap and rape her just like this woman she sees in media, that all her effort, time, prestige, etc means nothing in the face of biological reality, there's nothing stopping Bob from waiting for her after work and kidnapping her, this nothing stopping Bob from shooting up the office after sexually assaulting her, there is literally nothing stopping Bob BUT BOB, and if Bob snaps, there's nothing she could do to stop him  That's why women hate depictions of rape, its the ultimate reality check, the illusion of the current power structures between men and women fade away in an instant, that's why its such a shock to them and they take it so seriously when it happens, and there's all this outrage, because women can't think for themselves, they are very absent minded and not introspective at all, if a problem isn't in their face they will forget about it an ignore it.	https://incels.is/threads/why-women-hate-depictions-of-rape-in-media-its-a-reality-check.121504/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_why_women_hate_depictions_of_rape_in_media_its_a_reality_check.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_why_women_hate_depictions_of_rape_in_media_its_a_reality_check.tsv	1557673477	Blackpill Why Women Hate Depictions Of Rape In Media (Its A Reality Check)	24	2K	0

The sentence is to be apportioned as follows:  • 3 ½ years for sexual assault;  • 3 ½ years concurrent for invitation to sexual touching;  • 2 ½ years consecutive for making child pornography;  • 2 years concurrent for possession of child pornography.  [68] It was brought to my attention that the federal institution could interpret this judgment and the ancillary orders as recommending that Ms. D.M. not have contact with her mother given that her mother has custody of her children.

Story 1 A senior Tyrone in my school is known for how low-inhib he is: In a gang, calls one of his male teachers 'bald bitch' daily, and has no problem harrassing girls. One day a girl isn't in the mood and tells him to back off. This turns into a roasting match, witch turns into a screaming match, which turns into a 'fight'. I put fight in quotations because when you see the video, it's a 5'0 black girl putting her guard up against a 5'6 black man throwing everything he's got in a fury of punches. They both got suspended. Nobody cared when he came back. If anything he had even more friends. He's welcome to visit whenever he wants. Story 2 Over the summer, a white Chaduardo invites a girl over to her house. She accepts. He makes a move on her, she denies. They start drinking alcohol (they were wayy below the legal drinking age for anybody wondering) and as it turns out, chaduardo Hasnt actually been drinking this whole time. Girl is on the edge of blackout drunk and Chad starts to grope her, she says no, Chaduardo starts fingering her, she keeps saying no and pushing him, chaduardo tries to fuck her, she starts starts flailing and scratches him, he backs off. She called an Uber and went home. She told her friends and the school. Nothing ever happened. Story 3 Inceldo Gonsalez has a swim class for PE. inceldo sees his Stacy friend bring a two piece (even though it's against the rules). He goes and grabs her ass in the pool. She got upset told her friends. Administration found out and suspended him for a week. 5 of Stacy's friends tried to jump him in front of his mom. Every student is forced to have group discussions about sexual assault, consent, and feminism. No joke.  Moral of the stories is: rules only apply to the incels.

Morality is not for me. Does Chad have any morality? Does Stacy? They put us through hell on Earth and you want to feel sympathy for the beast that has been unleashed by their Fornicatory practises?

44	1550865606	IncelDisciple	'The bolded parts are absolute truth bombs.  I recommend any minority (Indians especially) with an inferiority complex towards white people to actually spend significant time around them. Hear about how the 2008 recession absolutely gutted working class white people and left many of them penniless. One of the first friends I made in college was a white kid from Colorado who narrowly escaped his home getting foreclosed and his family going absolutely bankrupt. One of my best buddies is a white dude from rural Oregon who graduated with an unemployable degree -- he was made further unemployable when the agricultural base of his hometown got flooded with illegal immigrants, meaning that he couldn't even get a job picking grass seed.  These are by and large problems that Indians and Asians don't deal with. We similarly don't have to deal with a media that is dedicated to screaming about how racist we are, or constantly bombarding us with passive aggressive messages. I can't even imagine how annoying that shit must be for the average white dude, I think this more than anything must have clinched Trump's victory.  We also have these things called strong families and an actual culture, both of which are sorely lacking in white suburbia. White families have a vastly higher divorce rate than Asians/Indians, guess how that goes for the kids. White dudes compose 35% of the population, but 75% of all suicides. I've had a number of close friends who were both white and Indian. I think I knew one Indian guy who was abused by his parents, while literally every single close white friend that I've had -- perhaps ten across my short lifetime -- had severely fucked up family situations, ranging from abuse to divorce to sexual assault to a history of mental illness.  Almost every single Indian American family that I've met has treated their kids like gold, at the very least done their best to ensure their success. I absolutely cannot say the same thing for the white families I've known.  Not to knock the parents of some of my white brothers who did a fantastic job, but it is impossible to deny that there is a strong culture malaise affecting white people right now.  You see it in the blatant self hate from white liberals, the preponderance of school shootings at the hands of alienated/crazy whites, and the demographic decline of White Americans in favor of abortions and feminist-fueled casual sex.  Moreover, there really is no cohesive white culture, no homeland for them to go to. When I listen to classical Carnatic music or the Qawwali singing of North India, I feel a connection with my ancestral homeland and culture. I can go back to India and find a five thousand year old culture that inherently belongs to me. As a Brahmin I can participate in ancient rituals and enter temples that would be closed to outsiders.  When I ask white kids how they feel going to Europe, they could give less of a fuck, outside of getting plastered they feel no connection with their ancestral heritage. Up to four hundred years separates white Americans from their ancestral homeland, but for us as Indian guys, we still maintain a strong link to our motherland. This is worth a lot. I recommend that any Indian guys with self esteem issues actually read more about the history of India. Do your Rajput, Sikh, Nair and Maratha ancestors proud, these guys were among the greatest warriors of their time, repeatedly defeating both the Muslims and the British.

0	1551599593	SlayerSlayer	I'm going to write a brief sexual history of Brad, a typical Chadlite:  Age 14: He lost his virginity to the girl next door, Jill. She was his first oneitis, They fucked each other when Jills parents weren't home, and fucked all summer long, 4-5 times a day and had sexcapades in his father's cabin, and Lake Shasta. He thought he was gonna marry her and live happily ever after.  Age 15: Brad freaked out and dumped Jill, because she got pregnant, Brad told her to get an abortion. At first she didn't, but then Brad's parents stepped in and paid her $30,000 to get it done. To this day Jill is depressed from the experience, and fantasies an alternate reality where she had the child and grew old with Brad, her first.  Age 16: Brad hooks up with Cindy, that chick from juvie. Brad gets into a world of drugs. Then Brad fingerbangs Cindy's sister, Liza, while she was sleeping at a house party. Liza was semi awake while it happened but she denies that it was sexual assault, and never tells anyone except a few friends that were jealous. He also fucks Monica after a couple dates, and gets a blowjob from Elana 3 days later.  Age 17: Brad dreams of becoming an aspiring DJ, so he downloads fruityloops and makes shitty house music, (he doesn't even like his own music, and blatantly rips off 'The Prodigy') yet manages to seduce a new whore every month, as some kind of hometown Steve Aoki. He fucks Becca after meeting at a club. Nikki after meeting at a restaurant. Casey at a house party. He fucks Jill again, only because she threatened to kill herself. Then dumped her ass. He makes a myspace page, and manages to fuck Cindy, Jeni, Kay, and Marla by the end of the year.  Age 18: Brad uses his DJ earnings to buy a Mustang (actually his dad paid most of it, but he did chip in $2000 out of 30K). He uses his Mustang to seduce and fuck a new slut every month in the backseat of his car.  Age 19-21: Brad becomes a drug and sex addict while attending community college in Santa Barbara. He fucked about 30 girls in this period of time. He broke his jaw after fucking a marine's girlfriend. and decided to take up Muay Thai to prevent shit like that from happening again.  Age 22-25: Brad transfers to Arizona State as a communications major, and joins Delta Sigma Alpha, the most notorious fraternity on Greek Row. The frat members keep a large scoreboard on the amount of sexual partners they have. Brad feels highly inadequate to not even be in the top 5. He simply cannot pull the kinds of orgies Chad can pull every day. He feels so inadequate compared to Chad he gets his parents to send him to an expensive shrink who assures him that he is far above average, since he does pull about 3-4 new bitches a month. Unhappy with what he perceives as lies from his shrink, he takes it out on a small-statured Pakistani engineering student, Gurdeep. Brad beats the fuck out of Gurdeep's balls, in a bathroom for 'being a tiny dicked sand nigger' and gets expelled from Arizona state. Gurdeep's testes were so heavily injured, the man could no longer reproduce or masturbate.  Age 26: Brad was sentenced 2 years for assault, his dad's laywer was able to get the hate crime offense waived. Brad served 6 months of his sentence. Brad became an alcoholic, when he moved back into his parent's home. Brad underwent a dry spell for a few months, until he forced himself to go to AA meetings. At AA he meets Marla again (a random slut he fucked from his myspace DJ days). They develop a close bond from being fuck ups. Marla takes it upon herself to change Brad and be her savior.  Age 27-32: Brad begins moonlighting as a pool boy. He starts to hit the gym again too. He and Marla get a ton of tats. Brad ends up relapsing into alcoholism and sex addiction again. Marla sticks by her man in spite of the blatant cheating. Brad ends up fucking a bunch of townie bitches he fucked back in his myspace days. He even drives back to Arizona state and attempts to sow his old wild oats again, forcing himself into a frat party he wasn't invited to. While he wasn't kicked out or anything, and managed to fuck a couple college hotties, the experience left him feeling empty.  Age 33-35: Brad returns to Marla, and wants to have a child. They have a Las Vegas wedding. Brad starts working for his dad's real estate business, and starts making a lot of money. They buy a house with a really shady loan, and he knocks Marla up. Then a few months later, Brad suggests that they have an open relationship. Marla thinks she is 'bisexual' so she reluctantly agrees. Brad fucks a lot of swinging housewives and MILFs during house showings. Marla vents her problems to her gay straight male best friend who listens to her and gave the couple his spare truck, when their car broke down. Marla copes with this, till Brad returns one day, and says he hooked up with Jill (his first) and tells Marla that he is in love with Jill. Jill cancelled her prospective marriage to Timothy for Brad. Marla freaks out, and they go into debt paying for marriage counseling. Jill attempts suicide. Timothy tries to get back with Jill, but she just can't, she will always be in love with Brad. Timothy then commits suicide.  Age 36: Brad becomes inspired by his marriage counselor and his experience from his time under bars to become a born-again Christian, Brad starts denouncing sluts, while occasionally relapsing with a Las Vegas whore every now and then. He eventually becomes a pastor. Brad tracks down Gurdeep, the Pakistani student he assaulted. He shows up to his doorstep. Gurdeep still lives with his parents. Gurdeep is a depressed mess from the assault many years ago. He forgives Brad, they hug, and Brad offers Gurdeep dinner. Upon learning at the dire situation Gurdeep has been in Brad suggests they start a computer repair business together, Gurdeep can be the 'tech guy' and he could be the 'marketing and guy and CEO.' As Brad drives Gurdeep back to his parent's house, he asks about his sexual situation. Gurdeep tells Brad he is still a virgin, he says this with more self-hatred than blame (and does not even mention his balls are just mush from Brad's doing). Brad can't help but laugh at his face. He tells him he might have better luck in India, then returns back to California. Gurdeep commits suicide 6 days later. Brad never checked up on Gurdeep after that forgiveness meeting.  To this day, Brad is still jealous of Chad.	https://incels.is/threads/the-sex-life-of-a-chadlite.110148/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_the_sex_life_of_a_chadlite.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_the_sex_life_of_a_chadlite.tsv	1551599593	RageFuel The Sex Life of a Chadlite	15	1K	0

Why the hell would you go to an establishment to pay women to rile you up and NOT fuck you, its the weirdest shit ever, it is the most cucked establishment one can enter into. Imagine if there were restaurants that people go to, where everyone gathers around the chef to smell the food as he cooks, get yourself hungry, mouth watering, and that's it, you pay the chef and you leave when you're 'satisfied' starving yourself. Oh and you can rent a private table to sit at with a plate of said food piping hot and a fan behind the plate to blow the aroma directly into your face, just so that you can experience maximum hunger  (what kind of retard fucking shit is this)  In that same sense molestation as a crime always confuses me, you're feeling a woman up, you're getting yourself hard, and that's it, you stop there, you might jerk off or just 'enjoy the experience and savour the memories' or some shit, but isn't that a waste of time, you are literally risking jail time to get an experience reminiscent to masturbation. You might as well just jerk off to porn instead and forego the risk of jail.  Why half ass sexual assault, if you aren't going to rape the victim then whats the point, you're just wasting time, go all the way or don't bother.	https://incels.is/threads/molestation-is-the-strip-club-of-sexual-assualt.109236/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_molestation_is_the_strip_club_of_sexual_assualt.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_molestation_is_the_strip_club_of_sexual_assualt.tsv	1551150500	Serious Molestation Is The Strip Club Of Sexual Assualt	19	594	0
0	1550866419	IncelDisciple	'The bolded parts are absolute truth bombs.  I recommend any minority (Indians especially) with an inferiority complex towards white people to actually spend significant time around them. Hear about how the 2008 recession absolutely gutted working class white people and left many of them penniless. One of the first friends I made in college was a white kid from Colorado who narrowly escaped his home getting foreclosed and his family going absolutely bankrupt. One of my best buddies is a white dude from rural Oregon who graduated with an unemployable degree -- he was made further unemployable when the agricultural base of his hometown got flooded with illegal immigrants, meaning that he couldn't even get a job picking grass seed.  These are by and large problems that Indians and Asians don't deal with. We similarly don't have to deal with a media that is dedicated to screaming about how racist we are, or constantly bombarding us with passive aggressive messages. I can't even imagine how annoying that shit must be for the average white dude, I think this more than anything must have clinched Trump's victory.  We also have these things called strong families and an actual culture, both of which are sorely lacking in white suburbia. White families have a vastly higher divorce rate than Asians/Indians, guess how that goes for the kids. White dudes compose 35% of the population, but 75% of all suicides. I've had a number of close friends who were both white and Indian. I think I knew one Indian guy who was abused by his parents, while literally every single close white friend that I've had -- perhaps ten across my short lifetime -- had severely fucked up family situations, ranging from abuse to divorce to sexual assault to a history of mental illness.  Almost every single Indian American family that I've met has treated their kids like gold, at the very least done their best to ensure their success. I absolutely cannot say the same thing for the white families I've known.  Not to knock the parents of some of my white brothers who did a fantastic job, but it is impossible to deny that there is a strong culture malaise affecting white people right now.  You see it in the blatant self hate from white liberals, the preponderance of school shootings at the hands of alienated/crazy whites, and the demographic decline of White Americans in favor of abortions and feminist-fueled casual sex.  Moreover, there really is no cohesive white culture, no homeland for them to go to. When I listen to classical Carnatic music or the Qawwali singing of North India, I feel a connection with my ancestral homeland and culture. I can go back to India and find a five thousand year old culture that inherently belongs to me. As a Brahmin I can participate in ancient rituals and enter temples that would be closed to outsiders.  When I ask white kids how they feel going to Europe, they could give less of a fuck, outside of getting plastered they feel no connection with their ancestral heritage. Up to four hundred years separates white Americans from their ancestral homeland, but for us as Indian guys, we still maintain a strong link to our motherland. This is worth a lot.

47	1550617752	BlkPillPres	 If you are physically submissive you are socially submissive by default, even if you find a woman who is attracted to whatever social appeal you have, and she goes along with being physically dominant to appease your sexual proclivities, you don't have any true leverage in the relationship, women by default have more social power than any man, what to stop her from leaving you, you aren't going to be seen as physically intimidating so she doesn't fear or respect you, and she can always get another man with more money and social status than you.   Your dream relationship is built to fail, its completely unnatural, you do realize that even in the good old days when the patriarchy was in full power, your relationship would not last even then.  I seriously cannot even comprehend how a man develops a submission fetish, how do you even develop it over time, it doesn't even make sense, wanting to dominate as a man is instinctual and even without instinct it is necessary to get what you want from life, so how does ones mind even begin to drift towards submission when you know full well you can't get anything with it, I just can't understand how it develops, is it random?, is it caused by mental trauma from sexual assault?, how does a man even reach this point?	https://incels.is/threads/why-femdomcels-are-never-mentioned-outside-of-the-forums.107839/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_why_femdomcels_are_never_mentioned_outside_of_the_forums.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_why_femdomcels_are_never_mentioned_outside_of_the_forums.tsv	1550574423	Serious Why Femdomcels are never mentioned outside of the forums?	112	4K	47

Then stay for the full duration if she does make you pay up front first.     They can't discriminate against you on looks, height, disability (only if you can't fuck) or race as any service provider can't. They can however stipulate in their terms & conditions advertised that you need to have good hygiene & pay up front & allow her 'to lead' that way you can't get done for rape or sexual assault if she's the one doing the action or so to speak.	https://incels.is/threads/prostitute-on-cucktears-tries-to-justify-stealing-from-clients-if-she-feels-unsafe-or-if-the-client-hasnt-showered.104392/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_prostitute_on_cucktears_tries_to_justify_stealing_from_clients_if_she_feels_unsafe_or_if_th.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_prostitute_on_cucktears_tries_to_justify_stealing_from_clients_if_she_feels_unsafe_or_if_th.tsv	1548755588	"RageFuel Prostitute on cucktears tries to justify stealing from clients if she feels ""unsafe"" or if the client hasnt showered"	45	1K	32

The investigation started when the Washington County Sheriff’s Office learned that a stable owner had a horse in her barn had been sexually assaulted. The woman’s daughter, a veterninarian, conducted an examination of the horse and “took samples of fluid found inside the animal.”  Kenneth Duyck was identified as a suspect in the case, and detectives found him at an area Walmart, sleeping inside of a stolen car. Duyck admitted to going into a stable without permission and touching a horse’s tail, but denied any wrongdoing. Duyck agreed to a DNA sample, which was a match to the fluid found inside the horse. In addition to the 20-month prison sentence, Duyck must undergo two years’ post-prison supervision and complete sex offender and mental health treatment plans.    	https://incels.is/threads/truecel-tried-to-rape-a-horse-but-got-arrested-and-caught.103501/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_truecel_tried_to_rape_a_horse_but_got_arrested_and_caught.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_truecel_tried_to_rape_a_horse_but_got_arrested_and_caught.tsv	1548380101	JFL Truecel tried to rape a horse but got arrested and caught.	38	929	0

3	1548377547	Weston404	Colin N. Perkel/The Canadian Press  Two men behind a free Toronto newspaper that promoted legalizing rape and denied the Holocaust occurred were found guilty on Thursday of promoting hatred against women and Jews.  In delivering his verdict against James Sears and LeRoy St. Germaine, Ontario Court Judge Richard Blouin called evidence of their guilt overwhelming.  Mr. Sears, 55, the editor-in-chief and St. Germaine, 77, the publisher, had argued Your Ward News (YWN) was meant to be satire but Justice Blouin found nothing funny about what was printed. If what they were doing didn’t amount to willful hate promotion, the judge said, nothing would.  “YWN repeatedly and consistently dehumanized Jews and women,” Justice Blouin said in his ruling. “Both men were fully aware of the unrelenting promotion of hate.”  The men, who will have a sentencing hearing April 26, face a maximum six months in custody and/or $5,000 in fines for each of two counts of willfully inciting hatred against an identifiable group.    The prosecution indicated it would likely be seeking a jail term but had yet to decide whether it would do so and whether it might ask that any jail terms run consecutively.  Observers said they could not recall another instance of a conviction for promoting hatred against women. Prosecutor Jamie Klukach said outside court that obtaining the guilty verdict was difficult, because the level of intent the Crown had to prove was “extremely high.”  Mr. Sears, who has two convictions for sexual assault from 1991 and who lost his medical licence in 1992 for sexual misconduct with three women, called the hate law “arbitrary” and the prosecution “politically motivated.” Comparing himself to a persecuted Jesus, Mr. Sears said he plans to appeal and keep on publishing.  “Two-thousand years ago, a man very similar to me was hauled up on hate-speech charges by the Pharisees and he was crucified subsequently,” Mr. Sears said outside court. “The same thing is happening today and I’m prepared to be crucified.”  An unrepentant Mr. St. Germaine was more subdued when asked for his reaction to the possibility he could end up in jail.    Story continues below advertisement    “I got nothing to say to you,” he said. “Whatever happens, happens. I’m not in control of the situation, the judge is. No regrets at all.”  At trial, the prosecution argued Your Ward News, with a circulation of about 300,000, mostly in and around the Toronto area as well as an online presence, was filled with “vile and degrading” articles and imagery.	https://incels.is/threads/dr-james-sears-toronto-pua-charged-with-hate-speech-against-women-and-jews.103492/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_dr_james_sears_toronto_pua_charged_with_hate_speech_against_women_and_jews.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_dr_james_sears_toronto_pua_charged_with_hate_speech_against_women_and_jews.tsv	1548377393	News Dr. James Sears, Toronto PUA, charged with hate speech against women and Jews	15	639	3

Monica Morrison: is a single freelance writer aka unemployed writer, age 33       Rob Langrick: Married with children financial executive, age 42     Monica Morrison, now 33, claims Rob Langrick, a senior figure at global investment watchdog the CFA Institute, tried to rape her in 2005 after she got so drunk at a frat party she passed out and was incapable of consenting.  The freelance writer says the pair merely kissed and talked in the cupola and claims she later passed out in her bed and awoke to find her underwear missing and Langrick trying to penetrate her while making 'disgusting' comments - such as: 'I want you to p**s in my mouth.'  After extensive eyewitness interviews, police in Hanover, New Hampshire, declined to press charges at the time. However Morrison says she was 'inspired' to revisit her alleged ordeal years later by the MeToo Movement, arguing officers would have taken it more seriously in the current climate.  Eyewitness report by third-party female housemate:  'Because she was present, awake, sober, and overheard the entire encounter, Ms. Johnstone knew that Ms. Morrison had engaged in sexual intercourse with Mr. Langrick in the cupola and that it was clearly consensual.'   just read it...purree....rage...fuel.   https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/ar...denies-sexually-assaulted-Dartmouth-coed.html   Cliffs: Is this real life?	https://incels.is/threads/actually-its-never-over-metoo.99018/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_actually_its_never_overmetoo.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_actually_its_never_overmetoo.tsv	1546643470	RageFuel Actually, It's Never Over...#metoo	20	1K	0

The problem is that as porn is a fantasy by nature they do what ever is necessary to create and maintain the illusions. Watch some British Amateur porn and see the dick size drop by a mile. A static camera and a little pecker going at it. Dick extenders are used allot and the higher the quality of the film, the better the quality the extenders. I mean cheap ones on Amazon are £5 and can go up from there. Listen boyos, a foid in the UK was recently sent to jail for sexual assault of other foids. She used a dildo and prended to be a man. Only shagging in the dark and wearing mens suits. A number of foids feel for it. She would ask the foods dick size preference and buy the size. The police seized... 8 sub 6 inch dicks. She found that the larger the dick, the more likely the foid was to ask for the light on due to pain. In essence, she inadvertently proved the myth of porn being real.

0	1545451698	Weston404	BACKGROUND  [3] The applicant self-identifies as a Filipino man, brown in colour and was 51 years of age at the relevant time.   [4] A summary of events as set out in the police synopsis appended to the Application is as follows. The applicant was a client at a massage parlour where a woman K. was employed. The applicant and K. had met several times for consensual sex.   [5] On the evening of Sunday, August 7, 2011, the applicant picked K. up at her place of work, and they drove and parked in a parking lot. At this time, they began kissing and K. willingly performed oral sex on the applicant. K. then took off her dress and laid down in the back seat of the applicant’s car. The applicant asked if he could have sexual intercourse with K. and she said yes. K. says that she then decided that she did not want the applicant to ejaculate inside her, so she told him to stop. The applicant continued and K. says that she told him again to stop and tried to push him away. K. says that the applicant then ejaculated inside her.  [6] K. says that she then told the applicant to take her to a pharmacy to get the morning after pill. The applicant drove to a pharmacy, and K. says that she told him to go get her the pill. The applicant refused and K. would not get out of his vehicle. The applicant then drove to the police station for 52 Division and asked the police to help him, as K. would not get out of his vehicle. The applicant states that K. refused to leave his vehicle unless the applicant would give her $500 for an abortion. The applicant states that this was extortion, and says that he explained this to the police officers.  [7] The applicant states that when he initially stopped the police officers at 52 Division, they spoke to him first and then went to speak to K. separately. After the police officers spoke to K., the applicant states that he was put in handcuffs and transferred to another police station at 41 Division. The applicant states that he tried to give his statement to the police, but they refused to take his statement until 6:00 a.m. the following morning. The police synopsis indicates that K. was taken to a hospital to have a sexual assault kit administered, and then attended at 41 Division and provided a video statement. The applicant was interviewed after K. had given her statement. The primary basis for applicant’s allegation of discrimination as set out in the Application is that he was not believed or taken seriously by the police because he was an older man of Filipino descent and brown in colour. In contrast, it is stated that K. is a young White woman who was not charged but was allowed to lay charges against the applicant. The applicant states that the police officers refused to listen to his side of the story, handcuffed him, detained him, strip searched him the following morning, and sent him to court.

3	1545451968	Weston404	LINK HERE: Corpus v. Toronto Police Service, 2013 HRTO 1141 (CanLII), <[http://canlii.ca/t/fzhs0](http://canlii.ca/t/fzhs0)  [25] The applicant alleges that the police should also have been investigating his allegation of extortion against K. but they did not do so, even after the sexual assault charges were dropped.  It seems to me that the allegation of extortion as raised by the applicant is inextricably linked to the allegation of sexual assault as raised by K. K.’s allegation is that the sexual intercourse initially was consensual but became non-consensual when she asked the applicant to stop because she did not want him to ejaculate inside her. K. alleges that the applicant did not stop despite being told to stop twice, and then ejaculated inside her.   The applicant’s allegation of extortion is that K. demanded $500 for an abortion or she would claim that she had been sexually assaulted. In any event, there is nothing in the Application or in the applicant’s submissions at the summary hearing that connect any decision by the police to not pursue or investigate the applicant’s extortion allegation to the applicant’s race, colour, ethnic origin, gender or age.

0	1545183995	Weston404	BY DIANA DAVISON, Special to the Toronto Sun  On Nov. 25, in his Toronto Sun column ([“We need to strengthen sex assault shield law”](http://takesper.gq/browse.php?u=6Gk7Cs30v8QcdddUVmte3skmIViBqSiN9jNVHuFV%2BPDUyRhkbLEUJ%2BCDUg%3D%3D&b=9)), Andre Marin claimed that he was “in a twilight zone” while debating my opposition to controversial Bill C-51 at a recent panel discussion.  Marin distorted the content of the debate by omitting the presence and arguments from the other panelist — distinguished defence lawyer Joseph Neuberger — and the event’s moderator, long time television/radio broadcaster and defamation lawyer Lorne Honickman.  It was easier for Marin to disparage me, a lowly civil rights activist, than it was to rebut the expert opinion from Neuberger that this bill will increase wrongful convictions.  The legislation under debate is widely seen as a response to Jian Ghomeshi’s acquittal on sexual assault charges. If passed, Bill C-51 will expand the definition of “prior sexual history” to include anything of a “sexual nature” and require the accused to disclose all text messages, or emails in their possession prior to trial.    Jian Ghomeshi, left, and his lawyer Marie Henein arrive at court in Toronto on Thursday, Jan. 8, 2015. (Nathan Denette/THE CANADIAN PRESS) Nathan Denette / THE CANADIAN PRESS Supporters of this bill have dismissed it as mere “housekeeping” to bring the Criminal Code up to date with decisions already made in the Supreme Court. Those who oppose it, like Neuberger, have called it a “catastrophic” shift in rules of evidence that will increase wrongful convictions. Evidence directly related to the sex act in question would have to be disclosed in advance.  The debate was punctuated with the appropriate amount of vexation towards such dangerous legislation.  While Marin argued that the bill would not have blocked any evidence used in the Ghomeshi case, he failed to acknowledge the devastating effect of giving a complainant advance warning of contradictory evidence. As Neuberger repeatedly pointed out, the complainant would have legal counsel to assist in blocking those texts or emails from trial and, with time to plan, could “tailor their evidence” around the inconvenient messages.   Kadian Noble cries as she recounts an alleged sexual assault by Harvey Weinstein during a news conference in New York, Tuesday, Nov. 28, 2017. She alleges that Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 2014 during the Cannes Film Festival. (AP Photo/Seth Wenig) Seth Wenig / AP The element of surprise is key to exposing lies under cross-examination but it can also expose flaws in memory. In cases of sexual assault, which Marin correctly noted usually have no witnesses, it is not just the complainant’s credibility that we need to test. As I pointed out in the debate, a complainant may honestly believe he or she is telling the truth but the evidence shows that memory to be unreliable.  I was amused to see Marin dismiss me as a “loudmouth,” but shocked he attributed quotations to me that were neither words I said nor representative of my position. I was accused of saying there was “data” and “lots of stuff out there” showing that false accusations were prolific. The only statistical assertion made was that false accusations are almost never prosecuted. Journalists who fabricate quotations don’t often suffer consequences either.  We don’t actually know the statistics for sexual assault or for false accusations. They are impossible to calculate with any certainty.  One thing that everyone agreed upon was that Justice William Horkins arrived at the correct decision in the Ghomeshi trial.    Perhaps Marin was right that I am a loudmouth but, if that’s what it takes to stop a bill that will send innocent men to prison, Marin’s flimsy character attack on me will not shut me up. As a member of the audience said, men are on “the front lines” hoping they don’t get wrongfully convicted while lawyers debate and say they will see how this “plays out” once the legislation is passed. It is not acceptable to send innocent men to jail waiting for Supreme Court to declare the new law unconstitutional.  Incredibly, Marin tried to bolster his position by quoting a tweet from Lena Dunham posted on August 4, asserting that women never lie about rape. Since then, Dunham has been [forced to apologize](http://takesper.gq/browse.php?u=oXw7U9jppM4GeJZETGhfj5Z6ORiFtmmK%2FCoJUuJc4%2FyXxB5%2Bd%2F8Ua%2FOaUwCZ00g%2Bjr1%2Foy2CRtR5tNUZp4wFqFeUrTuT6iAtIPxXHIFVHNaRoN8siVY%3D&b=9) for pronouncing that her colleague, Murray Miller, was falsely accused of sexual assault. While Dunham issued her apology under pressure, there is little doubt she continues to believe that Miller was falsely accused.     Bill C-51 is dangerous legislation designed to satisfy what Joseph Neuberger called “the ire of certain members of our community.” We are lost in the sea of an online outrage industry. Concern for due process is at an all time low. The question now is whether or not our legal system will pass this bill and cave in to the demands of vigilante mobs who still can’t accept that Jian Ghomeshi was acquitted because he was innocent of the charges.	https://incels.is/threads/false-accusations-legalized-in-canada-law-toronto-men-beware.95549/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_false_accusations_legalized_in_canada_law_toronto_men_beware.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_false_accusations_legalized_in_canada_law_toronto_men_beware.tsv	1545183995	Serious False accusations legalized in Canada Law (Toronto men beware!)	41	1K	0
36	1544990704	lessthanhuman	 I'm aware there was some cuck shit going on back then as well, but most of it had to do with rich vs poor rather than the way you looked. There were some absolutely hideous nobles and kings back then who got laid with ease. The same is happening today as well, look at sugar daddies, foids are fucking greasy fat old men just because they have money while we rot with no one because of our 'personalities'.  That said you do have a point that equality laws can be used to fuck over women as well, which is good. But the courts and laws will always go softer on women than men under 'equality'. Look at how female pedos get off so lightly compared to male pedos.  'The Title IX report concluded that there was not enough evidence to find Professor Ronell responsible for sexual assault, partly because no one else observed the interactions in his apartment or her room in Paris.2  Although the foid got punished, you can still see how the foid is getting off easy again, compared to people like Bill Cosby that did get charged with sexual assault. The problem is that everything is biased in their favor, so even under equality, they can abuse it and twist for their favor.   You are right I don't sympathize with tradcucks and cuckservatives who tell men to man up and protect used up spoiled whores. But in the past you did not have cucked laws about not hitting women, wife-beating and other abuse of women was more common, today women have the best of both worlds with both legal equality and social favor (e.g women and children first).	https://incels.is/threads/is-there-a-single-logical-reason-to-be-in-favor-of-womens-rights-as-a-man.95061/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_is_there_a_single_logical_reason_to_be_in_favor_of_womens_rights_as_a_man.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_is_there_a_single_logical_reason_to_be_in_favor_of_womens_rights_as_a_man.tsv	1544979591	Serious Is there a single logical reason to be in favor of women's rights as a man?	44	1K	36

58	1542573641	Robtical	That's what we need to do until the laws change. Incels and sub6 men shouldn't pay taxes until they get the same benefits out of them as everyone else. You can't justify enslaving sub6 men because of the debt that the cucked government got themselves into. Let them take care of it. I'll never pay taxes and many other people are waking up and refusing to pay taxes as well. I also encourage sub6 men to suck up as many free resources they can from the government for all the years of slavery and oppression they've endured. At least 80% of the population is struggling in some way like we are, so they will be receptive to the blackpill. The top 20% pay taxes too, but the 80% are paying almost everything for them and not getting any of the benefits. Sub6 men get no benefit from public schools, single mom care, women's shelters, police chasing 'child abusers' and 'sexual assaulters' all the time, etc.. The future is still bright. In a patriarchy he will have more smv and won't be incel at least, it doesn't matter if he's looked down upon by low iq foids if he's getting sex. Every year that accumulates. And I don't even want one cent of mine going to support whores and cucks. Foids still don't usually reproduce with chads, they reproduce with their beta cucks and create more incels. This is why foids need their rights taken for the good of everyone.	https://incels.is/threads/males-who-want-women-to-have-rights-and-freedom-are-evolutionary-failures.89745/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/males_who_want_women_to_have_rights_and_freedom_are_evolutionary_failures.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/males_who_want_women_to_have_rights_and_freedom_are_evolutionary_failures.tsv	1542507727	males who want women to have rights and freedom are evolutionary failures	297	7K	58

Plus foids don't have to commit major crimes because they have cucked orbiters to do their dirty work for them and take the blame.

279	1543344787	Robtical	Single mom whores and foids who suck on the government welfare tit don't need it. If you think they need welfare more than sub4 men need government funded hookers then you're not blackpilled. If they're that stupid then they can be changed. They won't listen to the media if the majority of their normie friends start getting blackpilled. To say 'just give up they can't be changed' is false. The more blackpilled they get and the less taxes they pay the bigger dent they will cause. Then if they want us to comply they will have to stop cucking us and fix the cucked system. For you to say 'just pay your taxes bro, we're stuck anyway' is what the jews want you to tell everyone. When life gives you lemons you got to make lemonade, and blackpill the incoming mexicans to turn them against the cucked sjws. The latinos don't mind conservatism as long as they still get to stay in the country. Plus not all conservatives are on our side, we need to blackpill conservatives too. They will be getting paid, people will give them gifts. Lots of people like doing things because they enjoy it. If I can run all the missiles and tanks I would do it. We don't need government thugs to do it for us. You have limiting beliefs to say otherwise, there are many possibilities if there was no government. Well we won't pay the taxes until they start fixing the cucked laws. We're ready to sink or abort the ship before they are. We need to keep growing before we can make a big impact. I'm just on regular facebook personality groups, or memes. and they're all anti-feminist.  Here's another normie using incel slang. Cope if you think normies aren't taking the blackpill because it comes from the 'evil incels.' What you seem to forget is cucks and whores are even starting to call normies and chad lites incels these days, so that insult has lost all its power.    It's not evil to foids and chads, for you to keep repeating 'muh necessary evil' is what (((they))) want you to say, even though the low status sub4's are the group who are mainly getting the evil treatment. We have to stand against them as much as we can until they learn to respect us. You can't just make up anything, it has to be at least founded in reality even without concrete scientific numbers. My assumptions are based on things that have been said here many times. Lots here condone it, so to say that isn't blackpill would be cope. The guys on PUA hate were probably a mixed bag like we are here, they had the guys who just wanted to ldar and they had guys who wanted to fight back. Anyway, ER was the one who put them on the map so it doesn't matter what they started off as initially, and they obviously had a lot of hate. A huge majority of people don't trust the fake news, that's all it takes to put a stop in their plans, and more people will start not believing them as time goes by. They won't allow themselves to be cucked with bad laws either, or they'll still kill their wives. Divorce rape is worse than cheating. That's why men need more money and status in their home countries to make them more attractive to their own women. Every girl I knew in university that looked remotely attractive had all the tests and study groups. Foids who see the professors in their 'office hours' go in and sweet talk them to turn in things late. But the study groups are the main things that help foids succeed, jfl if you think they do all their assignments and test preparation all by themselves like low status sub4 men in university. Being on welfare and having orbiters at the same time makes you rich. We need to take away their welfare to equal things out in the dating market. Men's way to attract women is by their resources, so forcefully handing that over to women who the men didn't consent to give it to is the same as rape or worse. Cope, it will go the opposite way if anything. Women are giving up on feminism. If the salaries of women 'increase' it will probably be more to do with inflation. We have to try our best to disrupt it until it stops cucking us. The main thing we have to do is not pay taxes then we'll go on the next step from there. My plan is the closest to a meritocracy, there will be no cucked laws and all men will be blackpilled. No men would ever marry foids who are sluts as punishment for their cock carousel riding, and they can't divorce rape men or scream sexual assault over every little thing. If you're against that kind of system then you advocate for laws that cuck sub4 men. If foids only had those freedoms to drive cars and get jobs and own property, and were treated like men everywhere else, I bet you wouldn't call it fair. You would say women deserve domestic violence shelters and and all this other cucked stuff. You wouldn't call low status sub4 men being forced to pay taxes to those they are being cucked by dehumanization? You probably would throw a fit if women were treated like men the exact same way under the law and in prison sentencing with no special privileges anywhere. This sounds like TRP cope. Sub4 low status men do in fact have difficulties many whores and chads don't have to deal with. I guess you haven't been here for long but that's why we say 'bitches live on tutorial mode.' If men had it as easy as women there would be 'true men' everywhere. But no, our cucked society decided to role out the red carpet for worthless whores instead. And you think that's just fine. More 'muh nature' cope. This is what sjws say and think is an argument. Not if you're sub4, low status and not NT. Of course anything women suck at like math or computers or making inventions are things I don't understand. They live life on tutorial mode so they can have almost anything to make them get ahead, we have to do the same for sub4 men any way possible. Anything femoids have a privilege in sub4 men should have that same privilege. That means no cucked harassment laws, or all female HR staff who make the decisions to only pick foids, chads, fags, and pathetic low t cucks. I'm subscribed to the blackpill, you're the one sounding like an sjw championing women's accomplishments and capabilities this whole time. You don't even believe foids live on tutorial mode and get free rides everywhere, and are let off many times when they get in trouble with the law.	https://incels.is/threads/males-who-want-women-to-have-rights-and-freedom-are-evolutionary-failures.89745/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/males_who_want_women_to_have_rights_and_freedom_are_evolutionary_failures.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/males_who_want_women_to_have_rights_and_freedom_are_evolutionary_failures.tsv	1542507727	males who want women to have rights and freedom are evolutionary failures	297	7K	279

The feminist Judge Kathleen Caldwell even refused to register McEwen as a sex offender, but granted that if the accused was a young man accused of #metoo accusations dated back in the year 1800, Kathleen Caldwell will force him to register as a sex offender and have his ankle fitted with a tracking bracelet.  What fucks my nerves is that the Judge knew that when McEwen sucked that baby boy's cock, he was 'giggling'....How many of us were deprived of having our cocks sucked by women, for free?  Why are womyn from Toronto only sucking cock on babies? His wife, Dylan Anne McEwan, appeared separately in court on Thursday morning. McEwan, 31, is jointly charged with Dickens on six counts including sexual assault of a child, making and possessing child pornography, and bestiality. She faces five additional counts, including sexual assault and making, possessing and accessing child pornography. Her lawyer, Magda Wyszomierska, told the court a bail application is being considered. Court documents show the offences allegedly occurred between 2000 and 2016. As part of the same probe, an unnamed 57-year-old woman from London, Ont., faces 10 charges including sexual assault of a child and making, possessing and distributing child pornography. Tina Ewen, of Thunder Bay, faces one count of making child pornography.	https://incels.is/threads/toronto-court-legalizes-female-pedophilia-as-femoids-allowed-to-have-sex-with-infants.85413/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_toronto_court_legalizes_female_pedophilia_as_femoids_allowed_to_have_sex_with_infants.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_toronto_court_legalizes_female_pedophilia_as_femoids_allowed_to_have_sex_with_infants.tsv	1540711374	RageFuel Toronto court legalizes female pedophilia as Femoids allowed to have sex with Infants	75	3K	75

We need to teach our youth the dangers of associating with gangs.” “Did you hear about the small town in West Virginia that has filed for bankruptcy because their local economy collapsed and now thousands of people there have to abandon their homes?” “Well, serves them right for voting for Trump!” “Did you hear about the thousands who have died this year due to the opioid epidemic?” “We have to educate people on the dangers of using these drugs so they can make better decisions.” “Did you hear about the young woman who was sexually assaulted by a guy friend who’s apartment she went to alone? Probably was a bad idea to be alone with a guy, right?” “OH MY GOD, STOP VICTIM BLAMING, YOU DISGUSTING CREEP. YOU ARE PERPETUATING RAPE CULTURE, YOU RAPE ENABLER. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.” ___________________________ #FeministLogic In all these other scenarios, it is a perfectly human, perfectly rational response to reflect on the causes of victimhood and note practical things victims could have done to minimize their chances of being taken advantage of and suffering their fate. Feminists don’t have any problems with this typical dialectic when it comes to any of these other instances of crime, victimization, and suffering. They only focus on one kind of victimization and impose ridiculous, irrational standards for how we should react to those cases. And they are completely oblivious to their inconsistency and double standards. But if we reflect more deeply, we should ask: Why are feminists so keen to impose this double standard? Why do they want people to avoid discussing the causes of sexual assault in a *holistic* manner? In all other instances of crime, we recognize the importance of a holistic approach. A holistic approach addresses:  1. Practical steps to stop criminal behavior. 2. Practical steps people can take to avoid being victimized by criminals.  But feminists say, “No!”  Tell me: is there any other crime where the ONLY way to reduce it is to insist over and over again that people not commit the crime? Is there any other crime where suggesting practical steps to reduce people’s vulnerability to criminals is considered “promoting criminal culture,” etc.? There is only one crime — sexual misconduct against women — where practicality and common sense go out the window. If you say anything about #2, feminists accuse you of being a “rape enabler” who is “perpetuating rape culture.” Why? It is because they know that addressing #2 contradicts their cultural program. Since the 1960s, feminists have been telling women *and* men:  “Be open and explicit in expressing your sexuality!” “Men and women should mix and flirt and have fun!” “Casual sex is liberating!” “There’s nothing wrong with being secluded with the opposite sex!” “Throw away your inhibitions, get out of your comfort zone, indulge your desires, own your sexuality!” “Experiment with sex!” “Soliciting sex from strangers makes you empowered!” “Dress like a slut because modesty is something the patriarchy invented to control you!”  The sheer suffering, misery, and destruction caused by this feminist cultural program is incalculable. One of the many results of it: more sexual assault, more rape, more harassment. But feminists don’t want to take responsibility. And they certainly don’t want to modify their vile, destructive ideology. So the only strategy is denialism. They just deny that it is their teaching and their messaging that are the true origins of rape culture. What’s really sad are the Muslim feminists. Like lemmings over a cliff, they militantly agree with their atheist feminist counterparts that Islam can’t help women. In reality, Islam’s insistence on hijab, insistence on male guardianship, insistence on ghira, prohibition of zina, prohibition of khalwa, prohibition of ikhtilat, etc., etc., all significantly reduce incidences of rape and sexual misconduct.  But Muslim feminists are not buying it. They fanatically agree with their atheist feminist friends that none of these Islamic guidelines are relevant to rape or do anything to meaningfully reduce sexual assault. According to them, the ONLY thing that can reduce rape is to tell men not to be rapists over and over again. They’re too dense to recognize the theological implications of this. The implication is that Allah did not institute a comprehensive system of morality and human relations to minimize the suffering of women. The implication is that there is no deeper, Divine wisdom behind Allah’s guidance that, when followed, protects women from assault. And the other more subtle but damning implication is that Islam doesn’t really offer anything unique or different from what feminism has to offer in preventing rape. Think about that. These Muslim feminists are essentially saying that the man-made ideology of feminism is on the same level as Allah’s guidance in stopping sexual assault. Instead of recognizing the unique Divine wisdom that permeates our Sharia, they simply take feminist platitudes and try to Islamicize them. And wherever Islam does contradict the feminist narrative, they minimize Islam or outright reject Islamic guidance. This is the depth of their delusion. Thankfully, the Muslim community is waking up to how toxic, irrational, and vile these feminists truly are.

The team of researchers from the University of North Texas and University of Notre Dame played 355 young women an erotic rape fantasy – as opposed to a literal portrayal of sexual assault – over headphones to investigate how aroused they became.  The tape's material, derived from the kind of storylines often found in romance novels, tells the tale of a male protagonist who is strongly attracted to the female character. He expresses a desire for sex with her, but she's clearly unresponsive. He attempts to convince her, without success, and she continues to refuse his advances. The male character then overpowers and rapes her. She resists throughout, and at no time gives consent. However, as THE MAN IS ATTRACTIVE to her and provides erotic stimulation, she does experience gratification from the forced sex. ​​   Well the fact that even a cucked Magazine like vice admits this Point is the ULTIMATE proof of the BLACKPILL​​  Women want to be Gangfucked up roughly into their asses until they cry​​  BUT ONLY BY CHAD​​  Just as a women would never admit to her girlfriend that she likes to be dominated, she would also never admit it to a incel​​  Because a women always wants to mantain the Illusion of being innocent and noble (at least for everyone except chad)​​  A women doesnt recognize a incel as a real male being, a incel is basically seen as extreme ugly women by her, thats why she will be upset at the slightest sexual turn from him​​   But the Bravo magazine told us that women do rather cuddle than actually having sex, and that a small penis is better because it does not hurt her​​   Well, Welcome to reality boyos………………………...​​     IT'S OVER!​​	https://incels.is/threads/nuclear-blackpill-women-consume-hardcore-bdsm-rape-porn-twice-as-much-as-men.82591/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_nuclear_blackpill_women_consume_hardcore_bdsm_rape_porn_twice_as_much_as_men.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_nuclear_blackpill_women_consume_hardcore_bdsm_rape_porn_twice_as_much_as_men.tsv	1539612322	Blackpill NUCLEAR BLACKPILL, Women consume hardcore, BDSM, Rape porn TWICE as much as men	18	1K	0

7	1539314647	Lord Byron	Not all foids. But enough to probably make it the most common sexual fantasy that exists. I had the pleasure of working in many second hand bookstores, and I read a lot of bodice rippers. Those are the type of novels that usually have a pirate or a cowboy on the front. Any example of rugged masculinity. The story always goes the same way. Pure and chaste woman is put in a situation where she isn’t outrightly forcibly raped, but rather she has no real choice about participating is sex. It’s always with pirate or doctor Chad tho. Never Bill the stablehand.  It seems pretty obvious this is just so they can enjoy sex without guilt. Nobody can call her a slut, because she was forced. Well not really forced, because she wanted him. But he didn’t ask her. He just tossed her onto a nearby bed, or bent her over his Ferrari. He was so big and powerful, and she was quivering and heaving.  We live in a culture where not explicitly asking if each sexual escalation is accepted and failing to demonstrate enthusiastic consent is placed on the same level as rape and sexual assault. Yet the majority of women are excited by men who don’t ask for permission. Where young women tell men to wait for them to approach, but if their fathers had followed their advice, those women wouldn’t even exist.  Getting some real mixed fucking messages here from the foids.	https://incels.is/threads/all-femoids-secretly-wants-to-be-raped-by-chad.81756/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_all_femoids_secretly_wants_to_be_raped_by_chad.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_all_femoids_secretly_wants_to_be_raped_by_chad.tsv	1539312997	Blackpill All femoids secretly wants to be raped by Chad.	25	1K	7

The suit claims she had just finished presenting an award at a company-wide 'Summit' event in January of this year when she tripped over one of her heels as she tried to 'navigate the large and alcohol-infused crowd'.  Anaya put her hand on a man's shoulder to regain her balance, and as she apologized and explained that she'd stumbled, the man grabbed her waist and 'forcibly kissed her', the suit says. She promptly shoved the man away and slapped him, but he 'just smiled at her'.   So this bitch was wearing heels to work (prob not necessary) and then tripped because of them and fell on some unsuspecting guy to catch her balance.  NO WAY guy just turned around and forcibly kissed her...thats fucking insane. He probably did smile and say 'You OK?' like any normal person.  The suit alleges that during Anaya's interview, WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann asked whether she drank tequila, and then poured her shots after she said yes.   Offered a drink = harassment   WeWork investigated this employee's complaints, took appropriate action, and this employee was terminated solely because of her poor performance.' The spokesperson said Anaya had 'received negative performance reviews, including one more than a year before she was terminated,' and that she was 'rated as one of the lowest performers on her team, based on feedback from her peers and managers'. 'Upon being terminated, she acknowledged her poor performance and that she hadn't been showing up to work regularly,' the statement said. 'She even expressed concerns about her performance to a colleague shortly before her termination.'  Anaya is seeking unspecified damages including lost wages and benefits, as well as attorneys' fees and lawsuit costs.  Also: Goodbye work-parties! It was fun whilst it lasted!   The company also stocks free beer at its locations and pressures employees to attend a 'mandated happy hour every Friday', according to the suit. WeWork 'Summits', such as the one where Anaya was allegedly assaulted in January, are described by the suit as 'a huge, three-day, alcohol- and drug-laden party for all employees at the company'.

Also to increase their likelyhood of sexual assault as it would give her the vital attention which is her oxygen for life.

In his latest video, he goes over a complaint filed against a group of girls who falsely accused a male peer of sexual assault and other crimes. It was later found that the whole thing was a conspiracy, but the damage has already been done, which is why the boy and his family are seeking legal recourse for malicious prosecution as well as taking action against the school and county for gender bias and equal protection violations.  This video is quite long (~37 minutes) but French leaves no stone unturned, reading some very damning excerpts from the complaint itself. When I heard about all this, it made my fucking blood boil.

0	1538854813	edgecel14	Brett Kavanaugh’s fate as a Justice on the Supreme Court hangs in the balance following a highly contentious day of hearings Thursday with him and the woman who accused him of sexual assault.  But even as he waits for a final verdict from members of the U.S. Senate, Kavanaugh has seen his stature rise elsewhere. The federal judge has become a hero to the sexually frustrated, misogynist “incel” community, after he claimed that he remained a virgin for years after graduating from high school.   Incels is a shortening of the phrase “involuntarily celibate.” It is a group of sexually frustrated men who gather in internet forums to complain about their lack of social status and the women they blame for it. And in various internet forums over the past few days, they’ve expressed interest in Kavanaugh after he claimed, in a Fox News interview Monday, that he never had sex in high school or for years after. Kavanaugh did so to dispute accusations from Dr. Christine Blasey Ford that he had sexually assaulted her during the summer of 1982.  “I did not have sexual intercourse or anything close to sexual intercourse in high school or for many years thereafter,” Kavanaugh said.  In response to that line, incel forums lit up with a discussion of the Supreme Court nominee, with one user saying they now saw Kavanaugh as one of them. David Futtrelle, a writer who tracks right-wing internet groups like incels, [noted on his blog](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2018/09/25/brett-kavanaugh-incel-hero/)that the Fox News interview appeared to have earned Kavanaugh “some enthusiastic new fans.”  “Kavanaugh being an incel once makes me him more lol,” wrote one poster in an incel forum.  Another poster wrote that Kavanaugh’s claim about his virginity boosted his support for the nominee “to 110%,” while one user on a Reddit forum devoted to incels said that Kavanaugh had inspired a new kind of incel, “Kavanaughcels.”  RELATED IN POLITICS [  Kavanaugh Ally: Maybe Accuser Confused Him With Classmate](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kavanaugh-ally-suggests-accuser-confused-him-with-classmate-doxes-classmate) [  They Were Sexually Assaulted—Here’s Why They Want Kavanaugh](https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-sexual-assault-survivors-who-believe-brett-kavanaugh-over-christine-blasey-ford) [  What the Hell Is Going on With the Kavanaugh Allegations?](https://www.thedailybeast.com/speed-read-what-the-hell-is-going-on-with-brett-kavanaugh-now) But not everyone was so bullish. Other users claimed that Kavanaugh’s claims about his virginity would doom his nomination.  ADVERTISING  “He doesn’t realize that the only thing women and normies hate more than rapists, it’s incels,” one user wrote. “He’s done.”  Incels, who often write about their support for sexual violence against women, seemed unbothered by Ford’s allegations against Kavanaugh. A Canadian man [accused of killing ten people](https://www.thedailybeast.com/man-suspected-of-mowing-down-pedestrians-in-toronto-to-appear-in-court) in Toronto with a van wrote on Facebook about an “incel rebellion” before the incident, while other incels [venerate](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-43892189) Elliot Rodger, who wrote an angry manifesto about women before going on a 2014 shooting rampage.  But Kavanaugh hasn’t won over every incel. While most of their anger tends to be aimed at women, the group also reviles socially successful men, a group they’ve dubbed “Chads” after a stereotype of a high school jock and bully. Kavanaugh frequently mentioned working out and his private high school’s football team during his Senate testimony, taking him perilously close to the jockish “Chad” stereotype, an idea that angered some incels. On incel forums, Kavanaugh is frequently referred to as a “Chad-lite.”  “Strikes me as 100% uberchad,” wrote one user.

0	1538473259	pooty	Many crimes and vices in the modern age are largely caused by the presence of foids. It could be categorised into 2 groups, 'crimes' against foids and crimes caused by the presence of foids. The former includes rape, domestic violence, sexual assault, molest etc. The latter is more broad and would include mass murders due to inceldom, financial crimes in an attempt to obtain wealth to impress foids with, revenge murders etc  Foids sow the seeds of discord; they lure and entrap man. They make man lustful and lecherous. Ordinary, everyday men will turn to beast of desire whose decision is led on by their penis. Even high-inhib men, with a bit of booze and whiff of poosi, will turn into hungry sex starved beasts, oblivious to his surroundings and consequences of his actions. Man will hurt each other and in more extreme cases murder each other to fight over that fresh juicy wet JB pussy. All these ultimately leads to crimes punishable by our currently pussy whipped legal system and will utterly destroy the lives of many men of great potential.

Then after a good nostalgic fap I see the original cap date which is back in 2014. Almost 5 years ago haha holy shit I felt really old so suddenly. It felt just like it was a few months ago. 1-20 was nothing but school school school 15-30 was nothing but work work work And now I'm 30 with nothing to show for it all. Just wasted my time because Incels can NEVER win in life.

28	1537836852	TheWitchKing	 'As the modern incel movement proves, it's the frustrated virgins who are often the most dangerous to women.'  Curious statement, considering that the controversy at hand is one involving an alleged sexual assault. The implication, of course, is that the frustrated virgin is the most likely candidate to rape. If sexual affection isn't given to him, if he can't win it through his charm or beauty, he'll seize a nasty parody of it. The incel is a ravenous beast, desperate and starving, forever on the verge of ravaging every fair maiden that catches his sleepless, bloodshot eye.  What a strange indictment against our sad little tribe. Yes, we have to bear the burden of men like Minassian and Rodger. Now, the bizarre fantasy our enemies harbor regarding us, the notion that we're all killers, is utterly absurd. If every incel was to follow in the footsteps of the tiny minority among us who took lives, one would be hard-pressed to find a spot of earth unstained with blood. If every ugly and unlovable man took up the knife or the gun, there would be calamity. Fortunately for those so apparently eager to defame us and make us the villains of their sleazy little fantasies, we are infinitely more likely to take up the noose.  Yet, I'll concede that men like Rodger belonged to our clan. Not a happy admission but, if we're to retain even a hint of integrity, we have to be more honest than those who lie about us. However, devils though these men may have become, they were never incubi. The demon they ultimately swore themselves to was not Lust but Wrath. Rodger murdered with his gun, committed assaults with his car. He didn't rape or strangle his victims because such acts, brutal though they may be, are intimate. Desperate though he was for intimacy, he didn't want his sole experience of it to be coerced. We see the same behavior in men like Minassian, Cho and the rest. They are killers, not rapists.  Now why may that be?   All too often, rape is not committed by the 'frustrated virgin' but a man accustomed to having women consent to his advances. He gets his way more often than not, isn't used to hearing the word 'no'. And yet, wonder of wonders, one day he does. The spoiled little child, used to having sweets handed to him whenever he demands them, inexplicably has his hand slapped away when he reaches into the candy tin. He's confused, he's hurt. So used to being given what he wants, when our little brat is at long last denied it he simply takes it.  Well, we wicked incels are more than acquainted with the word 'no'. We entered adolescence hearing it, became adults with it ringing in our ears. Not so much as the cheapest penny candy touched our lips, because even the tiniest hint of loveliness was considered too good to be profaned by the mouth of a monster. Instead of sweets we were fed ashes, our nostrils were filled with smoke rather than perfume. One won't find a gluttonous rapist among our ranks, because we emaciated ghouls have learned to starve.   Lamentably, one may find a murderer. Rarely, to be sure, and far more so than our critics would like. Yet sometimes one among us will call out to the Devil because both God and Man returned our cries of supplication with mockery and scorn. Weary of being denied the fruit of the Garden even the worst of men is permitted to taste, one of our fellow monsters may take the torch pressed into his palm by Wrath and try to burn Paradise to the ground, rendering all the sweet things he will never taste indistinct from the ash he spent an entire lifetime choking on.   If the virtuous want to hunt rapists, let them search their own ranks for the fallen angels trying to storm Heaven and regain it by force. Leave us monsters born down in Hell alone; lowest of the low and born beyond the light of Grace, we never fell. How could we have? We were never given an opportunity to.	https://incels.is/threads/kavenaugh-admits-to-a-crime-worse-than-rape-its-over-for-him.77087/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/its_over_kavenaugh_admits_to_a_crime_worse_than_rape_its_over_for_him.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/its_over_kavenaugh_admits_to_a_crime_worse_than_rape_its_over_for_him.tsv	1537829056	It's Over Kavenaugh admits to a crime worse than rape, it's over for him	36	2K	28
0	1538132700	Leucosticte	Even PUAs like Roosh can't get a tradwife. Even greater betas like Kavanaugh aren't protected from unsubstantiated sexual assault allegations. (Or, even if he does get confirmed, that still doesn't mean that the common man, who doesn't have access to a platform for defending himself before the entire nation, is protected from the system.)  I don't see a sign that politics is a viable option; as we saw with my campaign, when you try to raise incel issues, they drive you out of the race.  Well, there's this BBC Three documentary possibly coming up; but what good is that going to do? Let's suppose they actually covered blackpill issues fairly; then what? Maybe we attract more incels to sites like this, but that doesn't really directly solve our problems. It raises awareness, but we have no plan for what to do once we get a critical mass of support. Maybe we could have millions of supporters, but that still doesn't accomplish anything unless they can be mobilized to take some form of effective action.  It's over even for Chad. Yeah, he might get pussy, and reproduce, but that doesn't means his sons won't be incel, or get falsely accused of rape; or that his daughters won't be sluts or deranged blue-haired septum-pierced feminist spinsters.  It's over even for Linuxcels. Linus had to quit, because he was too offensive. You can't even be some fat geek who sits around devoting his life to improving software, without the SJWs hounding you out of your position.  Maybe the white race is simply done, and what's going to need to happen is that we just give up on civilization and leave the planet to be taken over by negroids living in mud huts. They might not have technology, but at least they don't have feminism. That could actually be the decisive advantage that enables them to continue existing, while our society perishes.	https://incels.is/threads/is-it-time-to-just-throw-in-the-towel-on-this-whole-species.77973/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/is_it_time_to_just_throw_in_the_towel_on_this_whole_species.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/is_it_time_to_just_throw_in_the_towel_on_this_whole_species.tsv	1538132700	Is it time to just throw in the towel on this whole species?	6	404	0

0	1537304833	TheIncelPill	We here on Incels.me often are accused of dismissing, or even ENCOURAGING violent sexual acts on women! I for one cannot let these accusations stain our community any longer. So I've taken the honorable duty of 'educating' my fellow Incels about this REALLY SERIOUS crime against womankind. Rape is everywhere, don't y'know? From the trashiest ghetto to the most lavish metropolis, women keep finding themselves used and abused by noncommittal, powerful, dominant men (#MeToo!). So it is YOUR job, fellow Incels, to protect these victims from our all-encompassing RAPE CULTURE. After they are done spitting and shaming you, of course.  So, what is rape exactly? We all know it is nonconsenual sex, but how does it look like? Well, here's the thing - we really CAN'T tell you what it looks like. Rape can be, well, anything! The classic Five Fs of rape response include 'Fight, Flight, Freeze, Fawn, or Flop.' So, if a woman wasn't fighting or screaming to get her rapist off of her...that's perfectly okay! She just decided to Freeze instead of stand up to the monster. If she helps him out and is affectionate towards him...well, that could also be rape! It makes perfect sense to Fawn/Friend the person you should hate more than anyone else in your life. In fact, according to Wikipedia, 'Most victims respond by 'freezing up' or becoming compliant and cooperative during the rape.' So it is actually quite UNUSUAL for a woman to stand up against her rapist. As an accepting society, we know that anything and everything can be rape, and thus there is literally no inappropriate response to rape. So, shut up, listen, and believe, your ignorant Incels.  Many conservatives have found themselves skeptical towards the accusations towards high status, white hot celebrities and politicians, especially Donald Trump and Brett Kavanaugh. Why would these women wait for years, only going public when these men are at their very highest? Well, I see where you're coming from, but can we cool it with the misogynistic remarks? I mean, after all, 'Trauma symptoms may not show until YEARS after the sexual assault occurred.' 'DENIAL is not uncommon.' So, yes sweetie, it is completely, 100% NATURAL for women to not file a police report, not tell anyone about the event, call it consensual or even have ANY negative effects whatsoever! So complete passivity or obstruction of justice doesn't prove the allegations are false! Sure, when under lie detector, 41% of rape allegations were proven false, but that just means that over half of them really do BELIEVE they had bad sex with an Alpha Chad were raped! So COOL IT and let these females wring these men out in the courts of law.  Lastly, let's address the statement 'Do women enjoy rape?' Now, from the surface, it may APPEAR that women are sexually aroused by these acts of intense dominance. BDSM, assholery, and 'ravishment' make up a huge, if not majority, of the romance novel industry. But these are just fantasies! They tell us as little about women as the dominance of Call of Duty and football games do about men. So we'll shove that under the rug. You may also hear that women uncommonly cum during rape. This in fact, false - it is probably a rather frequent event. According to one therapist just under half (~40%) of her clients have cum during rape. That's pretty strange, given that ~70% of women struggle or can't cum during consensual PiV sex. But this comes from the false belief that the body has ways to 'shut it down' against legitimate rape. Sorry, Todd Akin! A woman's body won't do, well, ANYTHING to defend itself against a man who knows what he wants and takes it. According to Wikipedia's 'Pregnancy from Rape' article, women can be twice as likely or more to become pregnant during rape! See, its not that she wants to be raped, its because she can't control her body screaming for this abusive asshole to have all her children. And that's probably from the Patriarchy!  So you see, guys, rape is a super serious seriously serious crime that only the most evil of Adolf Rodgers would even THINK of committing. We have an army of cat lady psychologists in a field that has less than 50% replicability rate to proof us right. So, seriously stop it with the rape jokes, and take every single girl for their word. Women still are not going to treat you like human beings, but if you don't...they'll say more mean things on the internet about you! So check your privilege, fellow Incels. Those Stacies risking it all to go out to the local bar dressed like hookers are our TRUE heroes.	https://incels.is/threads/psa-why-we-should-take-rape-and-its-victims-really-seriously-111.75471/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/psa_why_we_should_take_rape_and_its_victims_really_seriously111.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/psa_why_we_should_take_rape_and_its_victims_really_seriously111.tsv	1537304833	PSA: Why we should take rape and its victims REALLY seriously!!!111	15	731	0

Radfemincels, Leftincels & SJW Foids take it upon themselves to define what is and isn't rape for other women.  2. These  'male' feminist allies of them orbit those scum to see if they're any 'scraps' so to speak of pussy they can get from either them or any other women.  3. If they can't get it from them because the landwhales are taking their LARPing as lesbians that bit further. Then they rape other women after drugging them.  4. Appeal to the Radfemincels and other subhuman scum who say since we define what rape is and isn't then they didn't rape that woman and so it continues.  5. With those   acting as enforcers for those feminazi scum whilst they take pussy by 'strength or guile'. They then cover their tracks by attacking us calling us 'entitled', 'misogynistic' etc. 6. All the leftist   male radical feminist allies have or near about been uncovered for sexual misdemeanours. It's a long process but its all coming out in the wash. Deafening silence from Radfemincels when their allies get exposed. Even more deafening silence when they'll get exposed.  7.

0	1536122800	Incellectual	Think about it, sexual harassment can land you in prison and get you fired and all you do is make a foid uncomfortable. Just making a semi-sexual comment to a foid can get men in huge trouble when all they did was say something. Sexual comments dont even physically hurt foids they just make them uncomfortable and feel awkward but because of that society has to ruin the males entire life.   Another example is just touching a foid inappropriately without her consent can get you put in jail and the sex offender list, which pretty much fucks any chance of having a good life forever. All that just for making a foid feel icky for a few seconds. Its not even like its physically painful or dangerous, it just makes someone feel gross.   Before any reddit/tumblr faggot screenshots this and says I have no idea what I'm talking about I fucking do. At my first job there was another employee who would say nasty sexual comments to me all the time and no one gave a shit. He would full on grope me at times just to make me feel awkward and nothing ever happened to him. He even did this in front of the owner and they didn't care. But if he did that to a female everyone would of flipped their shit. He'd be at least fired and charged with sexual assault based on the times he would grope my junk. But at the end of the day, even though it was super uncomfortable and not enjoyable at all I moved the fuck on it wasn't like I was physically maimed for life.   I could give a 1000 other examples but I think you all get the point.	https://incels.is/threads/the-biggest-social-taboo-is-making-a-foid-uncomfortable.72186/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_the_biggest_social_taboo_is_making_a_foid_uncomfortable.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_the_biggest_social_taboo_is_making_a_foid_uncomfortable.tsv	1536122800	Serious The biggest social taboo is making a foid uncomfortable	26	891	0

47	1534938302	Ritalincel	Evo Psych, Incel Edition: “It’s your biological responsibility to rape a female and advance our species” AUGUST 7, 2018  · [101 COMMENTS](http://www.wehuntedthemammoth.com/2018/08/07/evo-psych-incel-edition-its-your-biological-responsibility-to-rape-a-female-and-advance-our-species/#comments)    Keep your sperm to yourself, you pieces of shit  By David Futrelle  Evolutionary Psychology is a problematic discipline to begin with, relying heavily on simplistic evolutionary “just-so” stories that for some mysterious reason always seem to reinforce the most reactionary notions about gender and human nature.  But if you add a dollop of incel ideology to the Evo Psych stew, you get something truly horrifying. Over on the Incels.me forum — a reliably repugnant forum popular with some of the world’s worst “involuntary celibates” — one commenter recently tried to use evolutionary biology to explain why rape was not only justified but something close to a sacred duty for all men who want to “advance our species.”  [“It is Your Biological Duty to Impregnate Females,”](https://archive.fo/1ycBB) ItheIthe began.  Weird, because there are plenty of people who have contributed mightily to human civilization without ever having kids, including Jane Austen, Susan B. Anthony, Beethoven, Leonardo Da Vinci, Isaac Newton, Debbie Harry, Haruki Murakami, and, er, Betty White, to name just a few on this [giant list](http://nkohk.forumotion.net/t16-the-long-list-of-childfree-and-childless-in-history) I found after literally ten seconds of Googling.  Also, what the fuck does it matter if you “advance our species” or not? Live the best life you can. Try to be decent to other people and nice to pets and other animals. Life is tough enough; don’t burden yourself with weird and grandiose expectations on top of everything else.  Donald Trump has five kids (that we know of). Neither he nor any of his terrible children are doing anything to “advance our species.” (Barron might turn out ok; we don’t know yet.) Indeed, there’s a good case that he’s dramatically increased the risk that our species might destroy itself and much of the world with it through nuclear war and/or unchecked global warming. His ignorant recklessness is one of the main reasons the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Doomsday clock is now set to the truly scary [two minutes to midnight](https://thebulletin.org/2018-doomsday-clock-statement/).  Up until this point, ItheIthe has mostly just been wrong. But his argument is about to get very, very ugly as well.  ItheIthe went back on that last bit pretty quickly after he remembered where babies come from. But first:  It’s a little hard to take someone’s “science” seriously when he thinks women are somehow a different and inferior species from men.  Well, that’s horrifying, but at least he remembered the basic facts of reproduction (even if he has forgotten about the existence of trans women and infertile people).  I guess traditionalists can feel grateful he’s remembered that whole “virgin/whore” dichotomy.  At this point I’m pretty sure he’s never talked to a woman outside of his family, or cracked a book outside of a math textbook or video game guide.  There are people in all countries — rich or poor, peaceful or war-torn — with some pretty fucked-up ideas about rape; hell, our shithead president brags about sexual assault. But there is no society on earth in which “no one gives a fuck.”  I think there must be a word missing at the end. Surely he doesn’t think women have any “romantic value,” whatever that means.  More to the point, the average American woman doesn’t have dozens of sexual partners over her lifetime (not that there’s anything wrong with that). As I pointed out only a month ago in a slightly different context, incels and MGTOWs and other misogynistic douchebags tens to wildly overestimate how many partners women have. In fact, according to the CBC,, [the median number of (opposite sex) partners](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nsfg/key_statistics/n.htm) that American women between 25 and 44 had over their lifetimes (as of 2011-2015) was 4.2; men had 6.1.  Virtually everything these guys think they know about female sexuality stems from fantasies rooted in misogyny and their own insecurity.  Referring to a woman as “it” — the cherry pit on top of this incel shit sundae.  Says someone whose biggest accomplishment in life is posting 3,993 messages on Incels.me under a fake name.  And on this thoroughly reprehensible note, ItheIthe’s wrapped up his latest contribution to the advancement of the human species.  ItheIthe’s argument got a mixed response from his fellow incels. While some commenters hailed it as “high IQ” brilliance, others dismissed it as the “autistic rant” of a cuck with an extremely poor understanding of biology.  “The reason incels exist according to evolutionary biology is simply because they are cucked by Chad due to his outstanding genetics i.e. survival of the fittest according to Darwin,” wrote warriorgenetics, perhaps the harshest critic.  But others found ItheIthe’s post, well, inspiring.  “If rape was legal it would be definitely better for us,” wrote someone called mentalcel.  “Rape isn’t even a big deal,” wrote armis, “they just get upset because it wasn’t Chad or Tyrone doing the raping.”  “What’s the point of dehumanizing the enemy if you don’t want to abuse them?” asked Atavistic Autist.  While more than a few of the commenters blanched at the idea of rape, some of them still found ItheIthe’s assessment of women persuasive.  Someone called engineerescortceller declared flat out that he didn’t think rape was “good morally” But at the same time he agreed with ItheIthe that “females”  I believe that’s what the regular psychologists would call “projection.” Hatred and self-loathing are a terrible mix — and the incel movement is an amplifier of both.  	https://incels.is/threads/it-is-your-biological-duty-to-impregnate-females.65737/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/it_is_your_biological_duty_to_impregnate_females.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/it_is_your_biological_duty_to_impregnate_females.tsv	1533612951	It is Your Biological Duty to Impregnate Females	51	2K	47

47	1534197045	znbox	 Because I've been through it and talked to people who've been through it and saw the consequences. Besides that, I used to research this topic a lot and have seen a psychiatrist for quite a long time. I can't not support anybody who's been raped. Of course, I'm talking about a real sexual assault, not some fake 'he touched my tits metoo' bullshit.  Btw, an interesting fact about raped females (especially if it was before they were 19-20 yo) it that many develop a victim mentality, not leftist victim though, but they become really submissive to any slightest signs of power. It's like she talks and says sorry as often as canadians. You see her and you mentally want to hurt her because she allows it. It's really fucking weird.  Some cannot have non-violent sex afterward. I mean there are a lot of interesting shit about people who been through rape, you can't even imagine.  They are different of course but treatment is similar in some sense, and the metaphors people imagine are surprisingly similar, except for grown man raped in prison or something like that.  I actually did think about the rape throughout history thing and why it's so important, and the conclusion I came to was that past times were violent for everyone. For example, about 50 years ago it was okay to hit a child in school (in some countries still is), but now it's unacceptable and traumatic. 100 years ago it was okay for a boss to hit his employee. It wasn't only men hit wives, it was everybody with higher rank hit everybody, and it was more acceptable and less traumatic than today. Because if everyone gets hit, you don't feel so humiliated. Similar to rape. For example, if one country got conquered by another, all men got killed, all women got raped. It's not like it was shitty just for women no matter what feminists say.  So like the more developed we get the less acceptable things like this become.	https://incels.is/threads/lmao-this-reddit-cuck.67125/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/story_lmao_this_reddit_cuck.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/story_lmao_this_reddit_cuck.tsv	1534176077	Story Lmao @ this Reddit cuck	65	2K	47

Thought experiments such as this perpetuate the idea that women exist for the pleasure and edification of men. You would never guess that women are people, not some amorphous being or abstract concept. The Beckys and Stacys they talk about are gross caricatures. Do not make the mistake of symphathising, they do not think women are human and as such they should be controlled-like a commodity.  Many have the luxury of thought experiments because the reality has never and will never happen to them.'  'Knowing how to, and willingness to love and care for others will vastly increase a man's chances for not just sex but good sex. It requires some courage and vulnerability. These men appear to be narcissists who have embraced a virulent form of libertarianism, framed in a Hugh Hefner fantasy. They can still learn to be loving, caring humans.'  'Agreed. What the so called Incels want is rape. The right to rape; sex when they demand it. They do not have a right to rape. If they are lonely, they need to work on their interpersonal skills. '  'The entire framing of this is wrong. Within the last 100 years women have started to not be treated like property (started, not completed yet). A true libertarian economist would realize that the best way to resolve a supply and demand issue in a market, here the sex market, would be to completely liberate women because the marketplace, as we're so crass to describe it, would clear itself without significant distribution issues if women didn't have to worry about sexual assault and had access to reproductive health care from places like Planned Parenthood. Instead of appreciating the economic, social, psychic, spiritual, philosophical, cultural benefits of liberating women, white men wring their hands that liberating women has left some men without sex and therefore angry. So once again we have to direct our attention to the violent, petulant, angry white man and his problems and see if we can come up with robot sex slaves since owning women is thankfully now out of favor. I'm so tired of white men and their nonsense'  ' Mr. Douthat proposes that “late-modern” sexual liberation and neoliberals have generated the loose, lawless atmosphere that’s created a new breed of women-hating, horny, angry, aggressive men. Blame it on Betty Friedan!  Right.  In fact, men have used rape as a weapon of war for millennia. If they wanted sex? They took it by force. And preachy orthodox religious men (Christians, Muslims, others) have repeatedly sought to isolate, control, silence, punish women to insure they, like brood mares, produced legitimate sons for their husbands.  Misogynists are an old old breed. Every woman worth her salt knows it. And no, sorry, Ross, not many women are out demanding sex “as a right.” False equivalence.  That’s a boy thing.

Yes studies show that there is a direct correlation between being sexually assaulted, and wearing the apparel of a harlot. Pants were always a male garment. Just even a few decades ago in America you could be arrested for cross-dressing. A woman in pants would be arrested, and charged with cross-dressing... What the hell happened to The U.S.A?!?!? We used to stand on male masculinity, and true female femininity. Now even the concept of Sex is under attack with generic / nihilist terms like gender. The lack of modest dress in American society has gone so far south that even in department stores they sell booty shorts (Shorts cut to the very top of a thigh) to preteen / teenagers.   Mainstream media laughs at the concept that the whore is destroying society. Scoff as they may it is true. Now the LGBT is pushing pedophilia, and it's all part of the plan to demoralize our nation for a Communist takeover.   If women insist on not being viewed as a sexual object than I'm going to assume they live according to those words. Wear a long skirt, or dress.

98	1531523219	Leucosticte	 If you get a virginal bride, you at least get a honeymoon period when she's enthralled by your body and the newfound wonders of sex, before the romance wears off and she gets bored and decides to bang the mailman. When you get with a non-virgin, you don't even get that much. Right off the bat, she's comparing you unfavorably to the Chads she banged, who were out of her league.   I thought I was the one who brought up their isolation, as opposed to ignoring it.   How do we set a standard of what's 'unnatural'? People develop all kinds of weird fetishes whose purpose can be hard to understand. When a girl gives you a blowjob or lets you fuck her up the ass, is that natural or unnatural? It doesn't produce babies directly. Nonetheless, the couple who does that stuff can also produce babies.  Maybe the fact that she did whatever he wanted in bed (including blowjobs and anal) was why he ended up staying with her; maybe he thinks other girls wouldn't be as submissive. That kind of stuff perhaps serves the purpose of bonding; [honest signaling theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolutionary_approaches_to_depression#Honest_signaling_theory) might say it's how she shows love in a convincing way. We know that girls who have had a lot of previous boyfriends will often refuse to give their husbands blowjobs and anal sex.  More generally, there's just a lot of weird stuff that goes on in human relations, whose purpose is a matter of speculation. Humor, for instance. Why does it exist; how does it help us survive and reproduce? Animals don't seem to have humor. What about crying; what biological purpose does it serve to secrete liquid from your eyes when one feels sad?  What about non-sexual affection; what purpose does it serve for, say, a little child to want to be comforted with a hug? The hug doesn't directly help him survive or reproduce, so why is his psychology such that he needs that kind of gesture? (These days, of course, non-relatives are often not even allowed to offer a distressed child physical comfort, or accept a hug from an affectionate child, because any form of touching might be construed as sexual assault or 'child grooming'.)  I could argue that anti-pedophilia is what's unnatural. Because people are so paranoid about pedophiles, it's become impossible in most cases for an older man to hang out with a young boy, and offer him mentorship and instruction and companionship, lest he be accused of trying to groom the child for sex. But not everything a boy might want to learn can be picked up just from his father, because his father isn't an expert in everything. So boys are naturally drawn to other men who can help them pursue certain interests.  Boys can't ride the subway by themselves (the way they might in, say, Japan) because people are worried they'll be kidnapped. So instead, to keep them safe, they're confined to a house and plopped in front of a TV, where theoretically no one can molest them. They don't get to explore and go on adventures and make up their own games, without adult supervision and control, the way boys of previous generations did.   I didn't agree to it. In fact, I dissent from it. All progress has to start from a dissident saying, 'This isn't working for me; I want to try something else' and going off on his own. That's what the Mormons in Utah, and the cult at Yearning for Zion Ranch, and many others tried to do, but society interfered, in the name of preventing abuse and disrespect toward women and whatnot.  One of the arguments against polygamy was that some first wives might not be cool with adding another wife to the family. But that's kind of the point; if the husband can say, 'You either have more kids with me, or I'll get a second wife who will' then she has to submit. It's very pronatalist to give a husband that power. A lot of times (like with the power to spank or beat his wife), he doesn't have to actually use it; he just needs to have it available.   'Preventing abuse and creating a harmonious society' might be the end, but the means by which people seek to accomplish this is by interfering with families. They're going to break up the family and put the daughter in foster care. It's antithetical to patriarchism to put some female social workers, and a female judge, in charge of deciding whether a father is raising his daughter properly. But that's what the law does.  There's not really all that much of a 'code of conduct' when it comes to child protection; the laws spells out some criminal behaviors, but the rest is left to subjective interpretation. You can try to fight for a reasonable interpretation, but you'll have to shell out a bunch of money in legal fees and wait for the wheels of justice to turn, while in the meantime you don't have custody of your kid.  Family law has been heavily influenced by feminist lobbying, and the family courts and social services bureaucracies tend to be dominated by feminists. So this is not a situation where masculine men have gotten together and said, 'Hey, let's have a code of conduct to prevent people from wreaking havoc.' This is a situation where feminists have said, 'Let's disempower fathers and empower feminist bureaucrats.'   Those are the hard cases that make bad law. We legislate to stop that kind of stuff, and we set a precedent that's going to cause problems later.  By the way -- if foids become traumatized and fucked-up in the head due to sex they had as a kid, there are two possible solutions to that: (1) euthanasia, or (2) discounting their SMV. E.g., if she otherwise would've been a really desirable girl, but she's mentally ill, you might say, 'Well, she's not quite desirable enough for me, so I'll pass,' but some other guy might want her. But if no one wants her, then she can just be put down like any other animal whom no one wants to adopt.  This isn't like the East Area Rapist, who was allowed to roam around freely. Foids wouldn't be allowed that kind of liberty in a patriarchal society to go wreak havoc, even if they were mentally ill. They would be kept on a leash, and if they proved to be more trouble than they were worth, they would be killed.	https://incels.is/threads/are-pedocels-the-worst-kind-of-incels.58984/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/are_pedocels_the_worst_kind_of_incels.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/are_pedocels_the_worst_kind_of_incels.tsv	1531078431	Are pedocels the worst kind of incels?	100	8K	98

Why oh why do Radical Feminists who preach 'Political Lesbianism' & not only that but 'Asexuality' & 'Chastity' (A variant of MGTOW possibly) to go along with it get a green card to preach their Misandry & bigotry but we are not allowed to vocalise our displeasure at how Society treats us whether we are short (me), fat (me), physically impaired (me), lacking in the Erotic Capital department etc. Surely that's some fucked up hypocrisy right there. Considering I reckon approximately 90% + up of those Radical Feminist 'Intelligentsia' are all Incels in 1 form or another. They're allowed to sprout their anger at the 'Patriarchy' but we can't retaliate at the very same 'Matriarchy' & 'hyper masculine' figurine of what Society expects of us. Oh yeah. Why do those Radical Feminists then have to go all 'Butch', 'Bullish' & 'Tom Boyish' on us if they hate masculinity so much. Dick envy much? I mean fucking ridiculous. Also why oh why are no statistics published of when these 'Radical Feminists' go on the rampage etc & their sexual assaulting of other women, abuse of their children or another's children etc. Just BS if you ask me.  Why oh why do Islam followers who shout 'Allahu Akbar' get a free pass & 'explanations' or 'excuses' as it were when they go on the rampage in the vain glorious attempt of escaping their miserable lives with the prospect of 72 virgins to cater to their every whim in a celestial plane all because they can't get laid in this life or if they do then they are just fucking greedy selfish murderous bastards BUT Elliot Rogers & that Minassian guy gets rightfully condemned (aware that's not going to win me any friends to some on here but I don't care though). Did Elliott Rogers & Minassian just leave out 'Allahu Akbar'? Fucking joke. Boston Bomber, 9/11 bombers and all other bombers have to be 'Understood' but Incels aka Men lacking in what Society idolises in manhood gets unfairly condemned for lashing out. Ridiculous.   I also hate the fact that Society presumes there's something wrong with us when time & again study, research etc proves that Looks or the initial attraction & chemistry is what matters in any short term or long term hook up. Also I hate it when these Ugly or physically unattractive men with gorgeous women are paraded around as some sort of 'Staknhovite Success' story when we don't know the arrangement & why they have 10s on their arms. I find that utterly conceitedness & down right disgustingly fraudulent.

This particular wave surfaced around 2012 and is highly associated with use of social media to promote its ideology and mentality. Since young people use social media at an extraordinarily high rate, this means that they are overly exposed to their talking points[1](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/). Because of this, the younger demographic of Western countries, especially women, are at a frenzy over an 'epidemic' of sexual exploitation. It is all destructively misleading and dangerous for everyone. Below is an excerpt from the Guardian about rape sentences in England and Wales:   Now here is data about the average length of sentencing in USA.   As you can see, sexual abuse, or rape, has an average prison sentence that more than doubles the average for manslaughter. Sexual abuse will get you 12 years on average. This contradicts feminist rhetoric that rape is commonly treated as a trivial crime with little punishment, such as this [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uk...iminals-let-off-with-a-slap-on-the-wrist.html](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/9782616/Rapists-and-other-violent-criminals-let-off-with-a-slap-on-the-wrist.html)  Sources: 1)[http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/](http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/09/teens-social-media-technology-2015/) 2)[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/26/rape-sentence-average-eight-years-justice-figures](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/may/26/rape-sentence-average-eight-years-justice-figures) 3) (for the chart) [https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/...atistics/state-district-circuit/2016/1c16.pdf](https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/federal-sentencing-statistics/state-district-circuit/2016/1c16.pdf)	https://incels.is/threads/rape-is-punished-more-than-manslaughter-in-so-called-rape-cultures.54774/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_rape_is_punished_more_than_manslaughter_in_so_called_rape_cultures.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_rape_is_punished_more_than_manslaughter_in_so_called_rape_cultures.tsv	1529715819	"Blackpill Rape is Punished More than Manslaughter in so-called ""Rape Cultures"""	10	719	0

30	1528829931	BillyBeta	 When will this feminist meme die? It basically exists to shame men who don't worship pussy.  Most MGTOW are ...  Divorceraped men who lost everything to a roastie in family court Men who were blackpilled by being falsely accused of rape or sexual assault, thus having their life ruined Normies who were cheated on by multiple girlfriends with Chad and/or Tyrone Blackpilled Chads and/or Tyrones who have slayed enough poon to last a lifetime and know the truth about female nature Some are indeed incels in denial but I'd say no more than 20-30% Also many MGTOW have just sworn off marriage and LTRs, but still date and fuck roasties. Not that many of them are volcel.  EDIT: Still want to add this. The whole 'MGTOW are just incels in denial' is also an incel coping mechanism. It's basic tribalism. You try to mock a group to elevate your own group, and get approval from your group members.	https://incels.is/threads/mgtow-and-nofap-cope-growing-popular.51820/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_mgtow_and_nofap_cope_growing_popular.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_mgtow_and_nofap_cope_growing_popular.tsv	1528825994	JFL MGTOW and NoFap cope growing popular	39	1K	30
0	1528678558	Deleted member 5861	1) Why do you people think that hating on harmless virgins who make posts online in some obscure forum makes you heroes? It is not for those 'mean' posts we make, oh hell no it is not. We are hated because we are incels (supposed to be, so many here aren't even virgins, fakecels.me) and we aren't happy about it. Just look at what happened to Goutham Sundaram just because he complained about his lack of success with white girls in his college. It was all over the news for being 'sexist,' he got kicked out of the tennis team, and a large portion of the audience (especially women) angrily stormed out of the building because of him simply being honest about his pain of being rejected by women. The closest thing that signifies him being 'entitled' is him saying Ghandi didn't starve himself so that he lacks success with girl. I don't see why saying that would justify hating someone, it just makes him pitiful, if you have a soul. Also why is there nothing like ISISTears? Probably because you lack the guts to attack anything that is dangerous at all. Maybe 1 in every million incels go on a mass shooting rampage. There are plenty of pro-ISIS comments on the internet that you can attack, but no hate on the virgins.  2) How are women oppressed when the entire goddamn western world AND all of mainstream media kiss their ass and treat them like Goddesses 24/7? How is there a 'rape culture' when there is a whole separate 'sex offender' registry? When being accused of rape/sexual crime can essentially end a mans life? Just look at Harvey Weinstein, lost his job and can't go out in public without attracting mobs of haters. I can already see 'but muh Trump' but he is actually an example of my point. Just a tape of him making a hyperbole of how being a star will let him be sexual with any woman got more hate than Satan ever got because of 5 words. Lots of guys are scared to talk of women BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO SCARED TO OFFEND HER! Shyness levels have never been higher, men are scared to be sexual with women because everything is sexual harassment. And as another poster said, 'Isn't it a paradox that men are constantly shamed for living in a patriarchal, toxic, rape-culture? A rape-culture wouldn't blast #metoo all over the news, gathering unanimous support from all but fringe hate groups (like us). I think women get treated like fucking heroes simply for living in such a 'sexist society'. There is nothing worse than being called a rapist.' Also if you are a rapist then you are treated with special disdain in prison, you could kill countless people including children and you wouldn't be targeted, but be a rapist and many of the prisoners will try to rape you everyday. Rape is considered the ultimate crime, for godsake 'rape culture' is the most retarded thing someone can believe. I remembered a girl said that her mom wanting the daughter to wear modest clothing to school because 3 guys were (falsely) accused of rape was proof that rape culture is real. Because her mom went to irrational lengths to have her daughter protected from the mean world, that is proof. Meanwhile boys have to learn to fight or they deserve it when they get bullied. Meanwhile nobody walks alone in the ghetto at night because...they want to stay safe. It is common sense all you retards. Groups who are truly oppressed are the ones who you DON'T hear about, at least not in a positive light. Take short men for instance, it is socially acceptable to bully them, discriminate against them, and dismiss them because of their height. The media does not go anal about how this is bad, they actually encourage it. Talking about how this is bad would actually get you more hated on, Napoleon complex anyone? There are also quotas where you have to hire women and it is illegal to under pay them. AKA there is no wage gap, just income gap because surgeons make more money than nurses. Lastly, about the cases where judges give rapists low sentences, people take the situation out of context. There are many cases in America where very petty crimes can get you 10 years in prison (even if white) and the same judge will give a murderer a 6 year sentence (even if black). The media picking out a few cases and saying 'this is the norm' is very disingenuous. The average sentence for rape is 8 years for 2009 in UK, LONGER THAN AVERAGE OF MANSLAUGHTER, which is also a country feminists say has a rape culture. Rape in US often have 15+ year sentences, even life imprisonment. Aggravated assault often gets only a few years.  3) This goes along to question 2, but what most low sexual crimes are is simply an unattractive man hitting on a woman. Serious, I could show images of #metoo where its just women complaining about a guy talking to them. Hell, sometimes you don't even have to be sexual for it to be sexual harassment! I've seen and heard cases of men getting fired for hitting on a woman. Even arrests. Videos showcasing the horror of being a woman and all the 'catcalling' they go through is bunch of men saying 'hi,' 'good morning,' and 'you got beautiful hair girl.' France is about to make that horrifying 'catcalling' illegal and fine men from 130$-1110$ for breaking it. I wish people were that nice to me, instead people call me ugly and gangs roaming around my area literally attack me sometimes. I would trade places with a girl in a heartbeat, you females will see what true mistreatment is. Can't even go to a store without seeing a female cashier smiling and flirting with a chad then the moment I come up she starts frowning and having an attitude with me. Legitimately treated like a subhuman. Not like some special Goddess who being associated with serves as a prize for men. Before you go 'muh too persistent' that is often not even the case. The first sentence and the women will scream sexual harassment. Besides, lots of women do 'shit tests' for normie men to see if 'they have balls'...to see if they're gonna risk committing a crime to be with them. Also sometimes 'sexual harassment/assault' is simply a man being too autistic. Since men have to make the first move lots of them who are less than socially savvy just go and touch them sexually as an attempt to flirt. Chad gets away with this all the time, its him being 'confident,' incels get a sexual assault charge/gets the girl on a frenzy. Then incels get very insecure from the humiliation. Then Chad tells him 'just be confident bro,' which usually makes the incel very angry. That is a major factor in all the hate here.  4) Why would a girl want a 'nice guy' to be her boyfriend rather than her platonic friend? Do you think politeness makes women horny? It is actually the polar opposite, you need to go to my 'ThugPill' thread for all the proof there. A man being abusive turns a woman on, that is the real reason why women always date bullies, thugs, and even physically abusive men. Virtually every male serial killer get tons of love letters from female fans. The 'nice guys are actually manipulative assholes' meme is simply an excuse for women to not date nice guys. So they want to be treated good and loved as well? HOW DARE HIM! Seriously, if someone was a legit nice person and everyone is mean back to him, do you expect him to enjoy it and just take it? Him wanting to be loved makes him an asshole? Everyone wants to be treated good, that is common sense, except for cucks. I saw those images of 'nice guys' being so sexually frustrated that they were attacking the women rejecting them, but that has nothing to do with women not liking nice guys. Those are just a few individual cases of loneliness driving them insane. Do you rather that person abuse and bully everyone so he ends up being liked? Women actually do, as long as he doesn't appear like a little kid playing around or a wannabe. Women want the good looking guys to act like men, like a real, primitive man. Women want ugly and beta men to not be attracted to them, their biological urges and psychological needs are just inconvenient, so women hate those men. Thats why they hate being 'hit on all the time,' HOW ELSE ARE GUYS SUPPOSED TO GET GIRLS?? Its a sign of Female privilege, you don't have to approach, it is the men who do. Its alot easier to complain that guys are always focused on sex when you don't have to worry about being alone. And Just like I mentioned before, they have attitude with those ugly and beta men and love to laugh at them getting bullied. This is also the reason why women like men who are tall and 'confident,' because they subconsciously think of them as primitive dangerous men. Remember that whenever you hear 'be confident' as advice to get women.  5) If rapists are commonly attractive men successful with girls, then how does that fit in with your assertion that incels don't get girls because they 'glorify rape?' Plus how do women tell that we make 'misogynist' posts anonymously on the internet when we're out in public? No, its not 'a reflection of your attitude.' Whenever I go on xbox live, especially in its heyday, other players would often threaten to rape my mother in one sentence then insult me by calling me a virgin in the next sentence. This was in mainstream games, filled with normies and chads. Lots of 'you're probably a girl, go back to the kitchen' as well. They get pussy, and they are just as edgy and 'misogynistic' as we are. Even rappers are just as bad, referring to women as 'bitches' and their 'property' in songs and women ADORE them. There are songs about downright torturing women and its the exact same. Those are the chads being 'edgy' like us.  6) Are you aware that you're probably at least just as big of a loser as us if you use Reddit? Just search 'reddit convention' and look at the group photos. About 90% of reddit users are total social losers, including those who just mock virgins all day and everyday on IncelTears. Notice I didn't say all, so don't say 'but I go out every weekend' since I know you people lack reading comprehension. You are not Chads or normies.  7) What is up with this whole 'mostly white' and 'white supremacist' thing you people have? We are disproportionately ethnic. 50% to be exact, and it might be more so on braincels. It is commonly accepted that whites have an advantage in the sexual market. Have you never seen 'Just be White Theory?' Racism is often an (extreme) cope for low value men, just like religion, patriotism, sports, and whiteknighting, so that is a big factor on why its somewhat common here among all races here. Also this forum is not so uptight about rough language at all, so of course you're gonna hear everything under the sun. People being alot more honest about themselves, instead of faux outrage over something on the internet lmao. Wow, such angels you are. You people are mostly far left virgins, the type to orbit women around and let them treat you like trash and even legit cuck you if managed to get in a relationship because you are so progressive (and have to since you lack sexual value). Far right virgins are more likely to be here. That doesn't mean everyone here is far right, though, only 28% identified as far right in my political poll. And no, that doesn't mean half of whites here are far right nazis. Ethnics here are just as often far right (lots of them support ethnic nationalism because they believe race mixing causes ugly people and to eliminate competition from other races). That can apply for the whites as well. Hating their own race but still supporting ethnic nationalism.  8) It is a commonly known fact that women are very selective in who they swipe for on tinder, while men right swipe practically every women. Most actually right swipe ALL women. So don't say women have problems with loneliness like a man does. Women are accepted no matter what their looks are. Don't go on about how they want a LTR or a platonic relationship. They can easily get that. Match for LTR and female friends for platonic, for example.  9) We know we aren't entitled to sex, because nobody is entitled to anything. Such a stupid argument from IT. Homeless people are not entitled to a house, do you go out of your way to tell them that when they are simply wallowing in misery? There are other posts here that confirms being involuntarily celibate is just as bad for your health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and worse than being obese. It is a serious issue, many people dismiss it as trivial when it is one of the biggest health hazards there is. Those 'gov't should redistribute sex' and other crazy threads are obvious venting posts. Other times it is just new members being trolls. Nobody legitimately believes that, but cucktears lack reading comprehension and they need to have their faux moral outrage to feel morally superior. Remember #5 before making a stupid response. Polygamy is anarcho-capitalism, monogamy is communism. The more polygamous society gets the more unequal the distribution of sex and girlfriends men have. The top 20% of men get 60% of women, just check it out on our blackpill archives. Each year it gets more and more unequal. eventually it will be 20% of men get 80% of women. Females chase those chads during their 20's then they settle for a man with lots of money to hopefully marry later on, lots of times pushing up to their late 30's. Often he doesn't get much sex if any at all because engineers aren't sexy.  10) Why don't you disprove our blackpill archives section filled with scientifically backed posts highlighting how life as an incel is hell? Why don't you have a scientific section? Go ahead, pick one of ours and argue against it.  11) If we are incels because of our 'toxic' personalities then why are we often depicted in your cartoons as ugly while the guy getting the girl is much better looking? I will tell you why, halo effect. Here is a quote from me. How do people react, especially females, to dogs? 'Awww how cute! Can I pet it? I want to take it home and raise it and love it for the rest of his life!' How do people react, especially females, to cockroaches? 'Ewww its so ugly! Kill it, kill it, kill it! Ugh I hate roaches. Fuck them I hope they all die. Why are the reactions different? Dogs are good looking, cockroaches are ugly. IT members love to spam out pics of low value ugly men with gf's and that disproves our theory. There are also many instances of people surviving being shot in the head with a shotgun. That doesn't mean you should expect to survive it. Everything has an exception. There are even women who love cockroaches. Common sense. Plus it is more than just how your face looks. All the factors that determine a mans chances of getting a date include: height, face, confidence/inhibition, natural social skills/NT, frame, race, money, and status. Add it up and that is a mans sexual market value. And as I mentioned in #8 you have to be at the top to get most of the action. And the range of the top who gets special access is shrinking more and more each year. You only have a limited range to increase your attractiveness as well. The 'just take a shower' to get a girl is like telling a poor person to apply for a job.  12) A woman who has had lots of sex is disgusting because her vagina has lots of cum from different men dried up in there and the vagina itself is wrecked. Likely a bunch of STD's as well. That is the prize for the engineer for working hard his whole life while chad got to fuck it when it was so much cleaner for the virtue of being attractive. Assuming the engineer even gets to touch it. Plus having more partners as a woman is highly correlated with her marriage being more unstable and a plethora of other problems.    13) The vast majority of serial killers and mass shooters consist of incel men because of the way society treats incels. Women play the major role in their mistreatment, either through their own direct actions like laughing at them or mistreating them and by dating the bad men as i said in #4. Of course incels here are angry, anybody who isn't cucked would be angry! The slaves at Haiti killed all the slave-owners in their revolution, and I don't blame them. The uncle-toms are a total disgrace to their fellow slaves. A good portion of you IT male cucks are the modern day uncle toms. Lastly, I want to hear your response to this quote, 'The child who is not embraced by the village will burn it down to feel its warmth' - African Proverb.  I dare anyone one of you to get pictures of my post and post it on IncelTears.

The power the male gets from it is meaningless in the scheme of it, what did he really do? stick his dick in a hole that's already had countless dicks in it before. He's done nothing to her that she hasn't already done a million times with countless other men, however this time she can get sympathy or compensation from it. This is the reason females constantly make up sexual assault or rape stories, they know the amount of power they can gain from it. The pure level of egotistical drive females have is what causes them to lie about rape and ruin someones life, it makes them retroactively decide something was rape and all of society will back them up, the male is innocent until simply speculated guilty. Its amazing how the number of reported rapes have skyrocketed since females decided that 'rape' doesn't have a clear definition anymore, roasties love having a rape story in their back pocket for when they're losing an argument or aren't getting enough attention.   The only way to maintain a form of power as the rapist is to either rape a virgin or kill her afterwards. That way you are either her first or her last, you have the power then...anything else is just providing the hole with an easy life living off of pity checks and public care.   Rape IS about power, but that power is given to the female.	https://incels.is/threads/rape-isnt-about-sex-its-about-power.47378/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_rape_isnt_about_sex_its_about_power.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_rape_isnt_about_sex_its_about_power.tsv	1527463556	"RageFuel ""rape isn't about sex.

12	1527116839	Pumkin	Hmm. I've been hugged. Are you asking if I've ACTIVE-ly hugged a female? Then the answer is no. I've never put myself out with outstretched arms and enveloped a female into my body. That is too much and by a guy like me that would be considered sexual assault.  I, however, have been hugged a few times. Probably like 3 girls in HS hugged me. One girl even gave me a behind the back hug. It felt wonderful she put her whole arms around my torso and squeezed so hard. Then someone said, 'Uhh....Vicki?' and then she looked towards my face and gasped, 'Oi! I'm sorry (Anon) I thought you were somebody else.' then she went to the back of the crowd to her friends and they were all laughing at her. It felt so wonderful but so sad at the same time. That the hug wasn't meant for me. That I'll never have a girl do things with me in mind. I've masturbated so many times to every single girl in my HS and college and work experience. EVER.SINGLE.GIRL! I cry at night when I come to the realization that nobody ever rubs their wet pussy to me. Because I'm an ugly dirty faggot Incel that deserves to die and will never find love or happiness.  Then I've been hugged by about the same amount of girls after HS. 2 hugs from work that were decent. Forgot the reason. Then my last hug was about 5 years ago. Really comfy hug. She had big breasts that pushed up against me and I could feel her individual nipples through our shirts. I had to go jack off after I left her sight.	https://incels.is/threads/have-you-ever-hugged-a-female.46165/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/experiment_have_you_ever_hugged_a_female.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/experiment_have_you_ever_hugged_a_female.tsv	1527116065	Experiment Have you ever hugged a female?	57	2K	12
0	1526798201	BabyFacedIncel	You know, she was wearing leggings with a wedgie up her ass, that she shows off to chads. I took a few glances as I put stock away, there was no one else around and I felt like I came close to just going behind her and putting my face in her ass and holding her there for as long as I could..   Which I knew I would instantly regret it after, I would be fired, charged with sexual assault, my face being on the news, put in jail, labeled as a sex offender. Despite all that I still contemplated and felt like I came close to doing it. Even almost accepting the consequences as extremely embarrassing but necessary. But I knew the regret would be too much.  Being a virgin well into adulthood is what creates tendencies to sexually offend. Cause if I was a chad I would just get her number and do whatever I wanted to, if I was a normie id have to look around and put in effort. But I am an incel and no amount of effort will get me anything, which I found out after trying throughout my teenage years and my entire adulthood.   Also, rapists are usually not incels. They are often normies or Chads who love dominating and controlling. But the people you see in the news who do a sexual assault like grabbing a femoids ass or breasts are often incels who do it sort of impulsively, often without a get away plan, seized an opportunity and just did it. And regretted it.   I often wondered why any incel would touch a femoid with all the bad consequences that will come after for just seconds of touching. I still dont understand why but I felt it, I felt that urge and compulsion today. I know I wouldnt have this temptation if I wasnt denied a human need my entire life.	https://incels.is/threads/today-at-work-i-felt-very-close-to-ramming-my-face-in-a-femoids-ass.44989/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_today_at_work_i_felt_very_close_to_ramming_my_face_in_a_femoids_ass.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_today_at_work_i_felt_very_close_to_ramming_my_face_in_a_femoids_ass.tsv	1526798201	Serious Today at work I felt very close to ramming my face in a femoids ass	26	1K	0

0	1525582277	BootyHunter88392	Are Prostitutes Better Than Normal Women?  A Short Essay by John Doe  Is it cheaper to have sex with normal women than with prostitutes? No, and here is why.  When you have sex with a normal girl, it's by no means 'free'. You have to take her out to dinner, buy her drinks, and you might have to go on two or even three dates before you will have sex with her. If you add up the total costs of these three dates, it would be approxiately around 400 dollars.  Now let's look at the cost of the average high quality prostitute. You can bang a prostitute for 2 hours for 250 dollars.  What are the benefits of using prostitutes instead of dating normal women?  1. The average prostitute is far hotter than the average normal woman you can date. 2. YOU get to do the choosing, and the power of choice is in YOUR hands, instead of in the woman's hands 3. With a prostitute, you have sex with her and that's it. No emotional drama, no mind games, no bull****, like there is with normal women. 4. You don't have to waste hours of your valuable time that you could otherwise spend on making money, taking women out on dates or trying to pick up women in bars and clubs. No, instead you pay a prostitute for one or two hours of her time, have sex with her, and leave. 5. You choose WHEN you want to have sex. So let's say you're a busy businessman, instead of wasting 5 hours at a bar or on a date, instead you'd spend only one or two hours with a prostitute, and that at your convience too. YOU are the one who chooses WHEN, and so you save a LOT of time. 6. Prostites are DEFINITELY cheaper than getting married. Overall, through a 10 year marriage and divorce, you'd end up spending at least 250,000 dollars. Now let's take that number and divide it by 250 dollars, which is the average price of a high quality prostitute in a Western country. That is sex with 1000 different high quality prostitutes. Now if you talk to any married man, who is HONEST, he will admit that sex with the wife after the first 6 months or year starts to get boring. And this is why people in long term relationships barely have sex, because it's BORING having sex with the same person time after time. Variety is the spice of life! You could have sex with 1000 different women for the same price it would cost to marry one woman and have sex with her. And considering how unstable most western women are nowadays, the chance of divorce is around 60%, with the woman initiating the divorce 90% of the time. You are likely to lose at least 50% of your assets and savings in a divorce, and so marriage to a western woman may end up costing you up to 500,000 dollars or even a million dollars, once you add in the divorce costs and long term child payment and alimony costs.  So let's take that number, one million dollars, and divide it by 250. That's 4000 DIFFERENT women you could pay to have sex with, instead of marrying one woman who will just end up turning into a bitch and divorcing you anyway. So it's your choice guys. Would you rather marry one woman, who will get bored of sex after 6 months, and end up stealing all your assets and savings in divorce, or would you rather have sex with 4000 different beautiful women for the same price?  Another very relevant point is that the world of modern dating has become quite risky. Most women see nothing wrong with making a false rape accusation against a man. Most rape cases are fake and are done out of a motive of REVENGE by the woman. Did you break up with your girlfriend? Watch out, she might make a false rape accusation against you just to get revenge. Did you cheat on your girl with another girl? Watch out, she might make a false rape accusation just to get revenge on you. Forgot to tell your girlfriend 'happy birthday'? Watch out, she might make a false rape accusation against you in order to get revenge on you. At least 90% of rape cases are FALSE, the sex was CONSENSUAL and the woman later changed her mind AFTER the act and decided 'oh it was rape'. LOL. And this is why the police no longer take rape cases seriously, because literally 90% of women who claim to have been raped are LYING!  So that is another HUGE benefit of prostitues. A prostitute won't make a false rape accusation against you.  What's another GREAT reason that men choose to use prostitutes? Because by paying for sex, they can have sex with a MUCH hotter quality of woman than they would normally. For example, if we rate women on a scale of 1 to 10 in terms of beauty. The average guy will be able to pick up and have sex with a 4 or a 5 from a bar, a club, or Tinder. Meanwhile, if the same man paid for sex with a high quality prostitute for $250 dollars (about the same amount of money he would spend picking up a 4 or 5 from a bar, club, or Tinder), the prostitute he would have sex with would be an 8 or 9 on the beauty scale. So for the same amount of money, he can have sex with a much hotter woman, and with much less effort too. Think about all the effort you have to put in to go to a bar or club. You have to buy good clothes, you have to spend lots of money on drinks and food, and also have to spend a lot of money on making sure your apartment is cool and stylish so the girl will feel comfortable there. So unless you're a man who was blessed with the looks of Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise and have women chasing after you, the easiest and cheapest option for most men to have sex with the hottest quality of women is to simply PAY for sex with a hot prostitute. One guy was asked why he paid to have sex with prostitutes and his reply was 'If I’m being brutally honest, the hottest women I’ve ever had sex with have been prostitutes … I would never be able to have sex with women who are ridiculously hot unless they were prostitutes.” I can also personally testify to this point. The types of chicks I was getting from Tinder were mostly fat or at best mildly hot, I would have rated them between a 3 and a 6 on the attraction scale. Then the first time I went to a prostitute, I was blown away with the options and the QUALITY too. Here were super hot girls who I could bang for such a cheap price. Needless to say, I gave up on dating and ONLY bang prostitutes now. I'm a much happier and peaceful person as a result.  Another couple of reasons that men gave as to why they choose to have sex with prostitutes are:  'Getting a prostitute is so easy: no strings attached, you can choose the woman you want before you purchase, then they arrive at your door. Couldn’t be easier.'  I can also testify to this. Getting a normal girl to have sex is a real pain in the ass and involves so much struggle, drama, and mind games. Then of course after you have sex with her, you have to deal with her stalking you, calling you so many times, and with her unrealistic expectation that you are going to have a committed and exclusively relationship with her. All that compared with the EASE of banging a hot prostitute, and the choice is simple. I chose to not waste time trying to date women anymore and only bang hot prostitutes now.  “We want to have sex without all the bull**** of pretending to be really interested in a girl. When you pay for sex, you don’t have to swap numbers at the end when you know you won’t call. You pay, have sex, she leaves. Everyone’s happy.”  This goes along with the above point. With normal women and dating, you have to PRETEND to care about her and PRETEND to be interested in her, when in reality all you want is to have sex with her. With a prostitute, there is no pretensions and that really is a beautiful thing because ultimately then sex becomes about the raw physical act as well as the pure attractiveness of the woman, and thus you are able to enjoy sex a lot more.  Lastly, let's touch on the issue of legalization. On average surveys, 70 percent of men said they would vote to legalize prostitution, meanwhile 60 percent of women said they would vote to keep prostitution illegal. Now it's pretty obvious why women want to keep prostitution illegal. Women use sex as a weapon to control men. So it would disrupt the economics of women's control over sex if prostitution was legalized, because then MEN would have control over WHO they want to have sex with and WHEN. Forget all those arguments about morality, the REAL reason women want to keep prostitution illegal is so that they can CONTINUE to control men with sex. In effect, women are like a mafia that is desperate to keep control of the sexual marketplace. If prostitution was legal, men would be a lot less inclined to put up with women's bull**** just to get sex from them, when they can go pay for sex from a much more attractive woman and without all the hassles and drama that dating and normal women bring.  What about STDs some of you might say? Well the whole STD scare is mostly a MYTH that has been blown way out of proportion by feminists and conservative religious leaders in order to scare men away from having sex. In reality, the rate of transmission of AIDS is 1 out of 700 during heterosexual sex. That is, if a man had penis to vagina intercourse with an AIDS-infected woman, it would take 700 times on average before he would contract it. The only way people get AIDS is through using needles to inject drugs, or having anal sex, especially with homosexuals. So the whole AIDS thing is a huge scare, a MYTH, that has been blown way out of proportion.  What about Herpes? Well studies show that 80% of the US population already has Herpes in one of it's forms, so that is not really an issue.  The only other STD that you would have to worry about is Chlamydia, and it can be easily cured within 3 days with antibiotics.  Now, that is UNPROTECTED sex. If you are using condoms to have sex with, then the chances of getting any of these STDs becomes less than zero. And that includes oral sex as well. Most prostitutes will insist that you always use a condom, even during oral sex. So as long as you are using condoms, then STDs are nothing you should even remotely worry about.  So what are some of the main reasons why prostitution should be legalized?  1. If prostitution was legal, it would reduce the STD transmission rate by about 50% amongst prostitutes.  2. If prostitution was legal, it would reduce rape by at least 150%.  Many studies have shown that legal prostitution reduces rape, sexual assault, and other sex crimes by a lot. The same studies have shown that legal prostitution reduces the STD rate amongst the general population by about 50%.  3. The real number of human trafficking victims in the prostitution industry is actually less than 5%. But if prostitution was fully legal, the tiny number of women who are forced into prostitution involuntarily would be able to go to the poliec to get help and escape from their pimps. Keeping prostitution illegal hurts prostitutes the most, so it's funny how feminists want to keep prostitution illegal and yet at the same time claim they care about women's health and women's rights. Feminism is nothing but the biggest pile of bull**** hypocrisy the world has ever seen.  4. Feminists say 'my body, my choice'. So if 95% of prostitutes are VOLUNTARILY engaging in prostitution, then why should those women have the RIGHT to choose what to do with their own bodies, even if that includes trading sex for money? What right does the government or anyone else have to tell two consenting adults that they cannot exchange money for sex?  5. It would save a lot of money and resources from our police and government. Tens of millions of dollars a year are wasted by our police and government arresting and putting prostitutes in jail. If prostitution was LEGAL, on the other hand, and taxed and regulated, it would bring in tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars a year in tax revenue for our government, as well as freeing up valuable police time for REAL crimes like rape, theft, murder, assault, etc.  6. If prostitution was legal, prostitutes would have legal rights and would not longer get taken advantage of by pimps and other shady figures, including corrupt police officers. Yes, the police also contribute to the oppression of prostitutes because there are many corrupt police officers out there who blackmail and extort prostitutes for money and/or sexual favors. If prostitution was legal, all of this would end and prostitutes would finally have legal rights.  7. Prostitution is the world's oldest profession. It is NEVER going to stop no matter how much the police or government tries to stop it. There are ALWAYS going to be men who are willing to pay money for sex, and there are ALWAYS going to be women who are willing to give sex to men for money. Prostitution has also been an integral part of many cultures and thus trying to stop it is literally impossible. And why should it be stopped? No one has the right to tell two consenting adults that they cannot exchange money for sex. So rather than waste time trying to stop it, just legalize it and tax it, the same way we do with cigarettes, alcohol, and now marijuana.  All in all, I believe in personal freedom. I believe that no one has the right to force their own sense of morality onto others. In some very ancient cultures, prostitutes were actually given very high status in society and considered as spiritual people who could heal men of their problems through sex. That was thousands of years ago though, before self-righteous modern western religions were invented and started violently forcing their concepts of morality onto people. Funny how societies that were thousands of years old were actually far more advanced than we are in the modern age in terms of sex and prostitutes.  It took almost a century for people to wake up and legalize marijuana, which is a completely harmless natural plant that hurts no one. In the same way, society and people in general have to EVOLVE and realize that they have no right to force their own sense of morality or control onto others. The modern society is actually a very sexually restrictive society, compared to cultures and civilizations of the past. And it's this sexual restrictiveness which contributes to so much psychological neurosis, sex crimes, and frustration in general. Is it a coincidence how people in America are so quick to anger and lose their temper, whereas in a place like Thailand where prostitution is legal and accepted, people are very laid back and cool headed? People need to stop seeing sex as such a big thing, and just realize that sex is a normal and acceptable part of life.  With that said, I believe that I have covered all the points as to why prostitution should be legal and an accepted part of society, and so this essay comes to a close. Please feel free to copy, paste, and distribute this essay as my goal is to influence and educate as many people as possible, the only thing I ask is that you do not change it or edit it in any way whatsoever.

17	1524826328	chadmarco	 I don't want to discredit them all like that, I mean that's a lot of bitches making the same accusations, which is what I think really hurt him. I just think woman can conflate having a bad sexual experience with rape, because in the bedroom men are expected to lead, and if you make a wrong move you can make a woman very uncomfortable, and that's all it takes to make a case for rape or sexual assault.  I mentioned the 2pac case which is a good example of this. He first met the woman in the club and approached her by placing his hands in her back pockets, basically touching her ass. She turns around, see's that it is 2pac, and is completely fine with the situation because shes attracted to him (now imagine if you or I did this lol). Fast forward to the incident where she claims she is gang raped and he was involved, after all was said and done he was only charged with unlawful touching of her buttocks because even she knows he didn't force himself on her. Now think about that, he basically committed the exact same crime upon meeting her, but it was okay because she was in a state of attraction, but the same act was unlawful simply because she felt uncomfortable while he did it the second time.  I think that its very possible that Bill assumed everything was consensual, when he was really making them extremely uncomfortable, which is an easy mistake to make when you're both high out of your fucking mind. We see the exact same scenario play out with alcohol. If a man and a woman are drunk and sex happens and she regrets it and claims rape or whatever, people will view the woman as the victim, not the man.	https://incels.is/threads/bill-cosby-found-guilty.39373/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_bill_cosby_found_guilty.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_bill_cosby_found_guilty.tsv	1524807062	Serious Bill Cosby found guilty	28	2K	17

Former sluts that want to make money can turn to whoring herself out for younger men or for married men, she will have no legal defense against rape, since she is offering a service, but it will be necessary for her to be paid.  2. Banning abortion, child support payments, alimony from male to female, will remove all incentives for females to divorce men and force them to respect the honorable institution of marriage.  3. Reduce the legal definition of sexual assault, make non penetrative forced actions such as kissing or groping and other forms of prosecutable offenses legal, only forced penetration of a virgin female would be illegal. Also 'marital rape' which is a ridiculous claim, since the act of marriage should ensure the wife will provide the husband with sex whenever he desires it, is not illegal.  4. There should be punishment for false accusations of rape by women. If found guilty of this offense, she will have two choices either she will never be able to accuse a male of rape again even if it occurs or she is given the same term the rapist would were he found guilty of the offense.   5. Females must not be allowed to vote, hold office or participate in politics, women are also not permitted to purchase or possess any weapons.   6 Clitorectomies should be encouraged to reduce female promiscuity. Sex or sexual acts such as kissing done outside of marriage should only be socially acceptable if the female is legally a prostitute. Forced penetration of a virgin female, outside of marriage, is punishable by death. If the female is a former slut, then no actions taken against her would be considered illegal. By becoming a slut the female loses her privilege of accusing a man of rape.  7. Females must wear burkas to cover their faces in public, they will not be allowed to wear revealing clothing, this will ensure females do not arouse the lust of men. Females that wear revealing clothing will be publicly beaten to unconsciousness for their first offense. For their second offense the female shall have her legs amputated. For her third offense the female shall be put to death. Any female that is forcibly penetrated while wearing revealing clothing, will be punished by death for inspiring the lust of the honorable man, if she accuses the man of rape.  8. Any action taken by the husband against his lawfully wedded wife is considered legal, this includes beatings for insubordination, the husband has the ultimate authority over his family and has complete control over his wife.  9. Adultery by the female in marriage is punishable by public stoning, or the husband can choose to personally execute her. Also deceit by a non virgin female attempting to pass herself off as a virgin for marriage shall be considered adultery.  10. Reduce the female age of consent from 18 to at most 14, like in Portugal. Ideally make it so that a girl is considered a woman as soon as she begins her menstrual periods. It should be customary to marry of respectable girls within 1 year after she turns into a woman, based on the legal age of consent, to limit the chances of pre-marital sex having taken place.	https://incels.is/threads/10-ways-society-should-be-changed-to-benefit-everyone.36618/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/10_ways_society_should_be_changed_to_benefit_everyone.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/10_ways_society_should_be_changed_to_benefit_everyone.tsv	1523871540	10 Ways Society Should Be Changed To Benefit Everyone	9	1K	0

0	1521234680	Total Imbecile	    Drayton Dwayne Preston broke into the bedroom of a 17-year-old Calgary girl who was passed out after partying with friends, raped her and then returned an hour later to sexually assault her twice more, while using her phone to take photos and video, which he posted to Facebook.   The victim, who can't be identified because of a publication ban, was in court in Calgary on Tuesday as Preston was taken into custody by a sheriff to serve a 26-month prison sentence.  Those details of Preston's crimes are contained in an agreed statement of fact prepared by defence lawyer Rame Katrib and prosecutor Pam McCluskey. Preston pleaded guilty to sexual assault several months ago.  Broke into bedroom through window Preston and a group of friends — which included his girlfriend, the victim, her boyfriend — were partying together on the night of July 29, 2016.  They were drinking, and when the victim became drunk, she and her boyfriend had sex in her bed and then passed out.  In the early morning hours, Preston removed a window screen and broke into her bedroom.  The victim woke up to him raping her but she passed out again in the middle of the rape.  An hour later, the teen woke up again. This time, Preston was on his knees at the side of her bed. She was scared and pretended to sleep while he continued to assault her twice more.  Once Preston left her room, the victim got out of bed and told a friend who had stayed the night about what had happened. While she was crying, Preston left the victim's apartment.  Video of assault posted to Facebook Later that night, Preston's girlfriend confronted the victim. She had seen nude photos of the girl on her boyfriend's Facebook page and mistakenly believed the victim had sent them to him.   Preston had used the victim's own phone to take photos and video, which, after the third assault, he posted to his Facebook account and then deleted them from her phone.  The video shows Preston walk up to the victim's bed, remove the blanket and spread her legs, all while her boyfriend is asleep next to her. The minute-long video then depicts Preston sexually assaulting the teen.  There are also photos of her genitalia.   Judge admonishes Preston 'It's a fundamental lack of respect for others that you demonstrated,' said provincial court Judge Gord Wong in handing down his decision.  'You're not satisfied with committing this sexual offence, you go ahead and use someone else's phone to take photos ... send it back to yourself and post it to Facebook.'  Preston will be on the sex offender registry for the next 20 years.  McCluskey noted that during a pre-sentence psychiatric evaluation with Dr. Patrick Baillie, Preston 'talks about feeling sorry for himself.'  Preston was on house arrest pending the sentencing hearing. He breached the conditions of his arrest three times and failed to attend court twice.

30	1521247226	TheWitchKing	I've only been to a strip club once. I'll confess, it wasn't a particularly pleasant experience. I've never really liked the idea of strip clubs. After all, I'm exposed to women who find me repulsive and would rather die than enduring my touch every time I leave the solitary darkness of my cramped little apartment. Irritating as that is, having the same experience while the women in question are doing their best to disguise their disgust in order to cheat me out of money has always seemed to me to be an infinitely worse prospect. A bit of vicious insult to an already egregious injury.  However, during my senior year in college a friend of mine started dating another student who danced at some seedy club. He felt a bit insecure about the whole thing and decided to invite his friends to watch his girlfriend dance. I'm not entirely sure what moral support he could have derived from his friends watching his girl grind up against old drunks for dollar bills but, well, the human heart is a complicated thing. So off to the club we went.  It was a seedy, nasty little place. The sort of place that didn't have a liquor license but one could bring one's own booze to if he so chose. I think the idea was that if someone got drunk enough and decided to grope, molest, rape or kill one of the dancers, well, at least it wasn't the club itself that sold the drinks that precipitated the sexual assault or homicide. Curiously enough, although miserable, the club had a certain halo of 'celebrity' around it. The proprietress was Busty Heart, a woman who had been featured on Adam Corolla and Jimmy Kimmel's Comedy Central show due to her ability to crush beer cans with the petrified balls of silicone some quack surgeon, far more greedy than he was talented or ethical, had shoved inside her chest. Clips of that episode played on televisions in the club on an endless loop just in case one happened to forget he was in the presence of a star.   Well, the evening was largely uneventful until the 'group lap dance'. It was sort of a nightly gag where the dancers would run over to members of the audience and do a goofy parody of a lap dance. Just after the dancers began to approach the men in the audience, I turned around to an ashtray behind me to stub out a cigarette...only to feel a crushing weight smash against my spine. It's hard to describe the sensation, almost like someone swung a bowling ball in a bag at full-force against my back. I'm a very slight person and I went flying, knocking over empty beer bottles and overturning ashtrays. It took a good while for me to catch my breath and stand up again, and I suffer from lower-back issues to this day.  Apparently, Busty Heart herself had decided to grace me with a 'lap dance' which, I guess, meant charging at me at full-speed while my back was turned and sending me sailing with her rock-hard implants. I suppose, in retrospect, I should have been honored. Though only a mere mortal, I had been touched a bona fide television star.  Sadly, all of the moral support I lent by showing up that night and nearly being murdered by Busty Heart's grotesque Frankensteinian tits was for naught. My friend later broke up with his stripper girlfriend and married an avowed lesbian.

On the whole rape and sexual assaults would go up, also false reporting for these acts too since women as a collective would be in panic mode wondering if the guy they fucked last night 'earned it'.

The 45-year-old woman was working at a refugee center in Sölvesborg when she began having a sexual relationship with the refugee, who claimed to be 18-years-old. When the migrant became an official refugee, he had to leave the center and so the woman allowed him to move into her family home. Within a short period of time, the migrant began sexually abusing the woman’s 12-year-old daughter, kissing and hugging her before one incident in September 2017 when the Afghan put his hands inside the girl’s underwear and groped her vagina. After the daughter told her mother what had happened, the 45-year-old refused to report the incident to authorities or even to ask the Afghan to leave the home, prompting the daughter to tell her father who then contacted the police. During the subsequent trial, the woman explained that she did not take action against the refugee because she was “afraid that [he] would be sent back to Afghanistan.” “I thought so much about him so he could stay with me,” she added. The mother also told the victim’s older sisters not to reveal what had happened. Facebook posts were later uncovered showing that even months after the sexual assault on her daughter, the mother described the Afghan as “wonderful” and was attempting to help him find a new home She was also reportedly a vehement supporter of the #MeToo movement against the sexual assault of women, but not presumably if those women are sexually assaulted by migrants. The Afghan received just 100 hours of community service for the assault and will not be deported. Although the refugee claimed to be 18 at the time of assault, the problem of migrants lying about their age to avoid harsher prison sentences has become notorious. An investigation by Sweden’s national forensic medicine agency found that three quarters of migrants claiming to be children were actually adults. Last week, new figures were released by Swedish criminal statistics agency Brå that showed rape cases increased 10 per cent in 2017.'  TLDR: Western feminist that hates white men let Arab thug rape her 12 yr old JB daughter and he got away with it, only 100 hrs community service, while he is still on welfare living in Sweden.

0	1513712324	ItheIthe	The popular narrative here is that 100% of women are just thirsty whores, ready to give themselves to whomever. While some are, I disagree that ALL women are. Gas me, I know.  But if you look at a girl's social media, or hear their conversations, a VERY GOOD PORTION of them are complaining about how guys don't really care. They complain about guys texting other women, guys cheating, guys using them, guys breaking up for no reason, guys only caring about their 'lay count', etc etc.  Now, imagine a world in which all women REFUSE to 'give it up' until marriage. I believe we are very slowly moving back in this direction with all the sexual assault charges, but we are a long way off. But in such a world, men (MOST of whom and primitive boars) will not be able to take advantage of women. They will not be able to focus on their 'lay count' (Unless they commit adultery, which would be illegal), and they won't be able to pump and dump or 'use' women.  The unfortunate narrative today is that abstinence is lame and ANTI-WOMEN. This couldn't be further from the truth. Abstinence is a code of conduct that is meant to protect both parties, ESPECIALLY WOMEN from being taken advantage of. It is a code of conduct that allows for true and meaningful marriages, and disallows what we are seeing today, which is many primitive boars taking advantage of women and passing them around until those women have very little value. Unfortunately, some of the men here want all women to be sex objects. The reality is, a lot of women currently ARE sex objects because of how easily they are persuaded by numerous men. The goal should be to enter a world in which women ARE NOT sex objects, and this will be attained through abstinence.	https://incels.is/threads/why-women-should-support-abstinence.8600/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/why_women_should_support_abstinence.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/why_women_should_support_abstinence.tsv	1513712324	Why Women Should Support Abstinence	18	974	0

So many coping manlets on TRP are throwing their lives into their careers and autistic hobbies thinking it will get them an 8/10 bombshell. Let Aziz be a lesson to you all. The blue pill doesn't work. The red pill doesn't work. There is only the black pill.   Watching the second season of his tv show was eye opening. The first episode has a really 'sweet' plot line, but having his ugly ass currycel, bug eyed, bloated cheek face play the part of the protagonist creeped ME out. It's very clear he wrote the part for himself imagining himself to look like Jake gyllenhal or Chris Pratt. I couldn't stop cringing when watching it after realizing this.   L O O K S A R E V E R Y T H I N G  Edit: and just lol that the roastie that was 'assaulted' could have said no and left at anytime, but she just felt 'awkward' about it. Holy shit FEMINISM IS CANCER. Metoo is a fucking disease that only allows femoids to completely eliminate STATUS as a bargaining chip for sex. They are literally whittling away EVERY SINGLE THING a man can do to make himself useful in the world and attract a suitable mate. Feminism's 'sexual freedom' is nothing more than a scam to let women fuck Chad exclusively, while they shame sub8 men for having a sex drive. Couple that with easy access to Chad cock with tinder, and birth control basically eliminating the value of a provider role, and the majority of men are now at high risk for inceldom.	https://incels.is/threads/it-is-so-over-for-curries-aziz-ansari-is-being-accused-of-sexual-assault.14539/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/it_is_so_over_for_curries_aziz_ansari_is_being_accused_of_sexual_assault.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/it_is_so_over_for_curries_aziz_ansari_is_being_accused_of_sexual_assault.tsv	1515990139	It is so over for Curries.

0	1516050740	ItheIthe	As a student-athlete, I now have to take a course about sexual assault on campus. Essentially the message is 'It's okay to slut around as long as there is consent!'  Honestly, I wish you could see what I'm looking at right now. It is completely ridiculous. Why do people think it is okay to slut around in general? What emotional companionship can a male or female who has practiced defiling themselves possibly bring to the table?  Drunk or not, hooking up is degeneracy to the utmost degree. I would NEVER 'date' a girl who has done a hookup. And it is insane how this course is glorifying 'communicating what you want!' in a hookup. How abut don't be a skank or male boar in general.  Inb4 Gambler on his new alt @GIRTH says something dumb defending degeneracy.	https://incels.is/threads/speak-of-degeneracy.14680/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/speak_of_degeneracy.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/speak_of_degeneracy.tsv	1516050740	Speak of Degeneracy	9	520	0

0	1515555281	Incel_Because_Short	I'd like you to meet Connor Neurauter:     http://www.thegauntlet.ca/u-of-c-campus-community-react-to-convicted-sexual-offenders-postponed-sentence/  He's a 6'3', white, good looking hockey player. I met the guy personally. He had girls fawning over him and he really had no problems smashing.  Recently he was sentenced 90 days of prison and have a sexual offender status on his criminal record for assaulting and choking a 13 year old girl, demanding she gives him nudes, and blackmailing her with them if she ever reveals their relationship. Her friend, a 14 year old girl, tried to get to stop by sending her own nudes, then went on to tell the 13 year old's mother who promptly reported him to police.  Given that he's a hockey player, the court only gave him 90 days and allowed him to finish his semester before doing his time in prison.  He was initially given prison time for over two years for holding child pornography, yet it was always delaying because he had, 'Hockey games'.  What's my point?  Here's a dude that's clearly not an incel who is a sexual predator.  Really think about it. Who's going to be more entitled to a woman's body?  A) A subhuman who realizes how unattractive he is to women and hates himself for it?  B) A Chad who gets rejected by one girl and feels she has wronged him?  The evidence speaks for itself. Look at Brock Turner. Look at how many professional sports players beat up their wives or commit other acts of sexual assault and get away with it.  The funny thing is that if this dude was a short, brown guy who doesn't play sports he would have gotten 10 years in prison minimum.  On my campus, a dude was arrested for two years and forbidden from being near campus grounds JUST for approaching women and asking them out on dates. This guy was a short, small-framed Asian. Meanwhile, this dude gets a tap on the wrist because he's Chad.	https://incels.is/threads/incels-are-most-likely-to-be-sexual-predators.13497/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/incels_are_most_likely_to_be_sexual_predators.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/incels_are_most_likely_to_be_sexual_predators.tsv	1515555281	"""Incels are most likely to be sexual predators!"""	15	1K	0

0	1515164863	FACEandLMS	The sites nearest in content to this one's: Lookism, r/incelswithouthate, and Looksmax are a shitshow when it comes to women posting. A thread by a woman usually goes viral. Women offer their metooism when it comes to the whole incel debate. 'I'm a woman and I'm incel too', conveniently not mentioning the orbiters they have, the fact that they either didn't install Tinder or did but didn't meet up with their matches, etc.   It's pointless discussing inceldom with women or allowing women to comment on it because they can't understand it. They can't suffer from it and they can't appreciate how it feels to be victim-blamed for being rejected. They can suffer from something akin to inceldom: lack of high quality potential suitors, where the only guys who want to date them longterm are below their lofty standards, but they can't appreciate being wholly rejected by the opposite sex.  - One of women's biggest fears is sexual assault and rape. i.e. an unattractive man finding them so irresistible that he doesn't seek their consent for intimacy. I bet even women who THINK they're incel or foreveralone still fear rape. 'No man wants me except those that are immediately turned on by me and just have to have me against my will'.  - Society listens to women when they say that looks matter to men; it provides them with makeup, figure-hugging clothing (yogapants, etc) to increase their looks, while men are bluepilled into working on shit that doesn't matter much initially: Confidence, Showers, Haircuts, Personality. Game. A man that doesn't appreciate a woman 'doesn't know what he's missing', 'doesn't know how to treat a real woman', etc. When a woman doesn't appreciate a man, it's cuz the man doesn't have enough game, is displaying some behaviour that woman are turned off by with their 6th sense, etc.  - Everything from pickup art to valentine's day is all about men trying to woo women. Men do the approaching. Women sit on their throne and filter the wheat from the chaff. Women are the gatekeepers of sex and dating.  - Everything we know about biology indicates that men have lower standards due to higher concentrations of the sex hormone testosterone and will be happier to settle than women will. Women who settle then intiate 70% of divorces. Scrap that: men don't see who they date around or below their looks level as settling precisely because of their high testosterone. it's the opposite for women.  They say that reddits foreveralonefemale or whatever sub went private cuz men were approaching the women. Men were solving their problem and ruining their martyrdom.   Women lack logic. Facts, statistics, observable reality, biology and studies are MEANINGLESS to them. They have an emotional response to most things and facts won't change that. They can't offer any insight on inceldom or female nature to men on incel sites. They are not selfaware enough to provide any useful advice. An incel site is not improved by allowing women to post. No incels are helped unless the incel was a fakecel chadlite, cuz then she'd be open to fucking him. Having a woman on an incel site is not like having a mechanic on a car forum. It's like adding pointless, bandwidth-hogging extra HTML markup and page-transitions. It's no help.   To have women allowed on an incel forum is to give in to women's 'LOOK AT ME!' attentionseeking nature. Most women only associate with male incel spaces to be treated like a princess, to see the number of alerts and inbox messages they get every time they come back, to offer bluepilled advice to feel as if their hypoagent logic-lacking arses achieved something. It's a curious circus to them. It's something to do between the last page-refresh they did of Facebook and the next episode of the Kardashians.  Incels.Me should always be a male-only place, after all, women CAN'T be incel.	https://incels.is/threads/i-commend-this-site-4-not-allowing-women-to-post-it-is-the-cornerstone-of-this-site.12484/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/i_commend_this_site_4_not_allowing_women_to_post_it_is_the_cornerstone_of_this_site.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/i_commend_this_site_4_not_allowing_women_to_post_it_is_the_cornerstone_of_this_site.tsv	1515164863	I commend this site 4 not allowing women to post.

9	1515129354	Ryo_Hazuki	 In all honesty I think it's more nature than nurture with regards to this.  Men are biologically hardwired to view other men as competition.  In the paleolithic era, men fought, and often killed, each other for a potential mate.  This behavior is observable throughout the animal kingdom.    [video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrHeKcZV7vA[/video]  Feminists (at least the smarter ones) fully realize men have this biological instinct and exploit it as much as possible.  This instinct is part of the reason male feminists exist in such large numbers.  Man is accused of sexual assault or rape with zero evidence?  Throw him in prison anyway.  Even if he's completely innocent, a man in prison is one less man to compete with.  A man made a politically incorrect joke on the internet in the 2000s?  Push to get him fired.  That will hurt the socioeconomic status of at least one male competitor.  High male suicide rate?  Good.  Less men to compete with.    Men are approaching women?  Criminalize it under the premise that it's 'harassment'.  Less men approaching makes it more likely I'll find and keep a woman.	https://incels.is/threads/sad-but-true-5-things-feminism-is-right-about.5169/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/sad_but_true_5_things_feminism_is_right_about.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/sad_but_true_5_things_feminism_is_right_about.tsv	1512150576	Sad But True: 5 Things Feminism Is Right About	22	1K	9

0	1513654113	Dingus_Incel	Intro   On an old incel related subReddit I had an essay about women and rape. I noticed that women, particularly feminists are obsessed with rape. They cannot stop talking about it, they are obsessed with it. They see it everywhere in society. This essay is going be mostly centered around American and the Western world.   Feminist Rape Hysteria    If there is one thing feminist are obsessed with its rape. Simply googling 'rape culture' or 'feminist protests' will find a great number or image responses. I won't spam this post with images of fat ugly feminists and their poorly made posters. Of course trying to point out the hypocrisy of naked women complaining about being objectified is wasted on them.   [img=800x504]https://everydayfeminism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/end_rape_img-f.jpg[/img]  Go to any prominent feminists website or magazine and fighting rape culture will always be a a major focus. Go to the unpopular ones and its still a key issue.   Feminist Fuck No: Its Not the Penis the Penis that Makes Men Sexually Harass Women, it's Power  Regardless of The Perpetrator’s Identity, Rape Is Rape!  Feminist.com: -565- documents were found to contain the word rape:   Rape Culture    Lets be blunt, there is no rape culture. That is a sensationalist and hyperbolic term. Its downright offensive. Despite what women want to argue, msot won't get raped irl. You often see stats like this.   [img=1200x817]https://www.rainn.org/sites/default/files/1_in_6_Women%20122016.png[/img]  You'll often see things claiming 1 in 4 will be abused or 1 in 5 will be a victim. They never flip this data around. 75-80% of women won't be raped or harmed. They also never talk about the male victims of sexual assault or the women who lie about rape. Estimates suggest 10-20% of all rape accusations are false. Although no one is totally sure how many are made up.  The fact is that no-one is taught rape. All boys grow up being taught to respect women. If anything feminists enable rape because of how much they support welfare to enable single mothers. As we all know, single mother homes are a factory for crime, including rape.   False_accusations_of_rape  Rapists Rarely Remember what their Victims were Wearing    One common trope you'll have noticed is that fmeisnts complain about not being able to wear what they want for fear of rape. Others attest that rape is a result of men being capable of controlling themselves around scantily clade women. There is basically no truth behind this at all. On a statistical basis no real correlation between a victims clothing and being raped can be found.    http://www.co[size=small]smopolitan.com/college/news/a30507/sexual-assault-misconceptions/[/size]  Most rape is between acquaintances, its not a result of a stranger going insane because he saw a short skirt.   Rape in the Real World   In the real world most rape takes place in Africa and the Middle East. So, if we're gong to be real there is such a thing as rape culture. Its clawed Muslim culture and black culture. But which two groups have feminists historically aligned themselves with, time and time agin. Muslims and African refugees. Do feminists desire to be raped by a Chad from Chad? Maybe. GERMANY: Muslim-loving leftist/socialist woman who was raped by 3 Muslim invaders apologizes to them.  [img=1500x1159]https://i1.wp.com/womanstats.org/laststatics/combinedscaleandsanctionofrape20113.png[/img]  Feminists don't care about rape. They hate the men of their own nations and want to replace the weak normies with alpha male foreigners.   I don't want to offend the blackcels here who are all law abiding citizens. But    A disproprotinat amount of rape is being carried out in America by black criminals, given their total population size. Many of the real rape victims are average black and white women, not Holywood whores sleeping around for jobs. But femisnt rarely discuss these harsh realities.   Pornography   In order to understand what women want I decided to 'study' pornography. I don't particularly like porn or approve of it, but I decided to skim though some rape porn to acquaint myself it. I noticed several common tropes amongst rape scenes.    'Actresses' often described how what was going to take lace was a fantasy of theirs.  Violence towards women  Muscular and very powerful men Multiple male assailants  African American males(criminality trope)  Pornhub, one the largest 'tube sites' for pornography on the internet regular publishes statists o their users every year. They break the data down by sex as well. Women routinely search for things like 'rough', 'extreme gangbang' and 'bondage'. BBC and black were also popular searches for women 2016.  [img=2480x3509]https://i.imgur.com/Ca9weBo.jpg[/img]  About 1 in 3 women watch porn at least once a week. Indeed, porn depicting violence against women is very popular, amongst women. Women are more likely to search for rough or violent pornography than men.   [img=620x859]https://img.4plebs.org/boards/pol/image/1452/18/1452181301400.png[/img]  Semi-Pornographic Fantasies   I'm just gonna copy an older post of mine, became it still holds up.   50 Shades of Grey is in itself a living blackpill. It sold over 125 million copies worldwide and is rape fantasy about a sweet submissive woman who is totally controlled both physically and psychology by a rich and violent Chad. She was living what all the 'silence breakers' claim to have gone through. Women who for years were supposedly terrified to do anything about powerful men sexually owing them. There really aren't any excuses that it doesn't represent women. It was written by a woman and harshly criticized by male book critics. Its primary target audience(women) ate it up. Its basically the female equivalent of the bible.   All this silliness about patriarchy and how society doesn't teach boys not to rape is bullshit. Its women who make this stuff popular. A female reddit sub voted a pornographic video depicting a rape dungeon to be the ideal woman friendly sex video. Its women who defend Chris Brown and R Kelly. Its women whose crimes and violence aren't taken as seriously.  Psychological Explanations   Some psychological explanations can be found here.   'Rape fantasies, in this understanding, are actually fantasies about surrender, not out of masochistic yearnings to be harmed or punished, but out of the female desire to be desired by a man to the point of driving him out of control. By this logic, the fantasy is actually about surrendering voluntarily after the coveted man, in his inability to stop himself, attests to the woman’s own supreme desirability.'   https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/insight-therapy/201308/what-do-women-really-want    - What Science Says About Arousal During Rape  'In recent studies, more than 90 percent of women admit having had sexual fantasies, and depending on the study, some one-third to two-thirds confess at least occasional fantasies of being forced into sex. Of course, sexual assault is a horrible violation. Why would any sane woman fantasize about it? A recent study suggests that rape fantasies are most prevalent among women who are the most erotically open and adventurous, who feel most comfortable daydreaming about sexual situations way beyond what they’d ever want to experience.'  https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201508/why-do-women-have-rape-fantasies  Why do women love rape so much? Anti-Gay Republicans as a counterfactual   My personal belief why women are so fascinated by rape is that it is a taboo. The have things backwards. They spend their entire lives being warned about rape. During childhood, they are warned of adult sexual predators molesting and killing them. They are brainwashed from an early age to be terrified of rape as the most traumatizing and painful thing on Earth. They are always being warned about dangerous places and procedure to avoid rape and defend themselves from attackers. All of that anti-rape narrative creates a kind of forbidden fruit effect.   Women become curious about rape and start to wonder what it would be like. It becomes a dirty fantasy. Then the shame kicks in nad they start to feel guilty. So they put on a hysterical anti-rape facade. This, to me at least, is not dissimilar from the anti-gay republicans who get caught being gay.   [video=youtube]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMsG9ScQP9I[/video]  Conclusion   Women seem to think about rape, a lot. Why they think about it so much is debatable, but the contemporary explains are at least plausible in the moment. What we know is that a lot of them can't stop talking about it, adn a lot of them can't stop fantasizing about it. I plan on amending this essay in the future with more data. Feel free to send me information to further beef this paper up.  You're stupid if you don't think feminists want to be raped.   [img=400x400]https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/704718906754265088/1L7xDllB_400x400.jpg[/img]  [img=800x450]https://thumbs.mic.com/ZGUyNDk5NmJjMyMvWEFhMmFPOUFDbEJoSGs0RDV6UUVnajJpbzdVPS8weDE6ODA5eDY4Ny84MDB4NDUwL2ZpbHRlcnM6Zm9ybWF0KGpwZWcpOnF1YWxpdHkoODApL2h0dHBzOi8vczMuYW1hem9uYXdzLmNvbS9wb2xpY3ltaWMtaW1hZ2VzL3dxamxqczN5Zzd4cTZ5aXVmbG1ocDFxZnZoencyaDh4bHlqanVra2hqMGpydHI1ZXYza204ZnFoanJ3ZXB1aXIuanBn.jpg[/img] 	https://incels.is/threads/women-are-obsessed-with-rape-long-essay.8470/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/women_are_obsessed_with_rape_long_essay.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/women_are_obsessed_with_rape_long_essay.tsv	1513654113	Women are Obsessed with Rape [Long Essay]	12	1K	0

44	1513550229	VLÖ	 Yeah maybe that, but I was referring to your absolutely fucking ludicrous idea of just kissing her with no warning. That's literally asking for sexual assault charges as an ugly male. If you're ugly you're automatically under suspicion, so you need to first prove that you're actually harmless and THEN try being 'assertive' very slowly to ensure you don't cross the line too soon.  Obviously none of this applies to Chad, but we aren't Chad ffs.	https://incels.is/threads/getting-ready-to-go-on-a-date-from-tinder-tinder-morph-game.8180/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/getting_ready_to_go_on_a_date_from_tinder_tinder_morph_game.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/getting_ready_to_go_on_a_date_from_tinder_tinder_morph_game.tsv	1513537009	Getting ready to go on a date from tinder (tinder morph game)	111	5K	44

Take one look at the sluts on the street today and you will know it's over. They cannot possibly be the next generation of mothers. Meanwhile, powerful, talented, hard-working men are dropping like flies because of highly dubious sexual assault allegations and having their careers destroyed because of it. Regular sub-8 men are working long hours and putting in intense work at the gym yet end up dating single mothers or landwhales.

0	1513307851	NegroKing	The parody tag is for any autistic Cucktears members who may be reading this and think it's a serious post  Hello, I'm an Indian male living in the US. I wanted to share a story of how I was able to use solid frame and kino to score with a white HB 9 and how my beta friends ruined it.  So it was Saturday night. Me and a group of friends decided to hang out at one of their houses. One of them decided to bring along a friend of his, a beautiful blonde with great tits and ass. I had other plans for the night but I dropped them the minute I saw her. I knew I had to get her alone.  For most of the night we were all chilling in the living room. My friends were all orbiting this hot chick. It was pathetic. At one point, she had to go to a room upstairs and talk with her boyfriend. I saw my opportunity. While all my blue-pilled beta friends waited, I went upstairs to follow her. Once I heard her finish talking to her boyfriend, I approached her confidently and started talking to her, making her wet with my humor and raw power.   I then started to escalate using KINO. I put my hand on her neck but she told me 'I'm sorry Pajeet but I just don't find you attractive. And I have a boyfriend'. Shit test, I thought to myself. There was no way she thought I wasn't attractive. I'm muscular and alpha as fuck. So, I proceeded by negging her-calling her a dirty slut- while continuing the kino escalation, and before I knew it I was inside her. She was screaming, telling me to stop and shouting that I was an ugly, smelling creep. I kept going, my frame was unbreakable. She wanted it deep down.  But things turned sour. My beta friends arrived at the scene and jealous of my sexual conquest, declared that I was committing sexual assault and called the cops. Soon enough, the cops did arrive. The girl, ashamed at the fact that she enjoyed getting fucked by a high SMV alpha thug while having a betabux boyfriend, confirmed their baseless accusations in order to save face.  As I type this, I'm sitting in jail. It's going to be a while before I get out, but I'm going to use this opportunity to go monk mode in between getting my ass ripped apart by Tyrone's BBC every time I take a shower. So the lesson? NEVER have sex near your beta friends and ALWAYS hold frame.  The end.	https://incels.is/threads/parody-trp-field-report-a-great-night-ruined-by-my-beta-friends.7696/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/parodytrp_field_report_a_great_night_ruined_by_my_beta_friends.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/parodytrp_field_report_a_great_night_ruined_by_my_beta_friends.tsv	1513307851	[Parody]TRP field report-A great night ruined by my beta friends	5	527	0

I was wondering why it seemed odd compared to normal woman bullshit, and it hit me; This is weird because someone like Charlie Rose or Mario Batali may have done something fairly innocuous, but they're not allowed to defend themselves, nor is anyone else crazy enough to defend them. That would be admitting that sexual assault and just being a gropey old dick aren't always the same thing, and we can give no ground on that front. So everyone is scared into silence lest they be branded an advocate of rape.

Are you aware of the sheer volume of caste-based hate crimes - especially sexual assaults that target lower-caste women due their lack of power - that happen every day in the subcontinent? Murdering lower caste men for marrying, dating or even interacting with higher-caste women is common even in purportedly anti-Brahmin states like TN.  The penultimate paragraph is pure cope, illiteracy would be even more endemic in India even if colonial powers hadn't exploited our labor and natural resources. Some of our brightest historical figures were educated abroad in the UK and would not have been as successful were it not for their exposure to the European intellectual milieu.   I would have expected something like this from Indian SJWs but right-wing Indians love to infantilize their entire race by blaming all of their cultural problems on foreigners.    The Quran explicitly proscribes premarital sex and mandates that adulterers be stoned as retribution. Nonetheless, the same Muslims that get extremely offended whenever someone talks shit about their vulgar cult consistently plow hundreds of low self-esteem Europid femoids while insisting on a pious Muslim wife. Muslim Chads should be stoned in accordance with their religion if they love it so much.    Most Indians who subscribe to Christian beliefs tend to practice some sort of Christianity imported by the Portuguese and British. Modern forms of Christianity hold little resemblance to the actual teachings of Jesus.	https://incels.is/threads/why-are-there-so-many-muslim-currycels-on-this-site-and-the-discord.2852/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/why_are_there_so_many_muslim_currycels_on_this_site_and_the_discord.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/why_are_there_so_many_muslim_currycels_on_this_site_and_the_discord.tsv	1511071367	WHY are there so many Muslim currycels on this site and the discord?	66	3K	46

The millions of rapes and sexual assaults committed by non whites will be ignored or explained away as 'part of their culture'.	https://incels.is/threads/woman-punched-in-the-face-by-man-she-asked-to-stop-manspreading-on-new-york-subway.2768/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/woman_punched_in_the_face_by_man_she_asked_to_stop_manspreading_on_new_york_subway.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/woman_punched_in_the_face_by_man_she_asked_to_stop_manspreading_on_new_york_subway.tsv	1511042836	Woman 'punched in the face' by man she asked to stop manspreading on New York subway	41	2K	6

Ask any man in a corporate position and he will probably complain to you about the required female diversity programs and sexual assault training.

0	1510953282	FemaleInventionsLOL	Rape: A guy the woman didn't find sexually attractive tried to force sex with her.  Sexual assault: A guy the woman didn't find sexually attractive tried to make sexual advances towards her.  That's it. That's all these words mean.  Think about it. If Tom Brady were to walk up to a woman and strip her and 'rape' her, she would most likely enjoy it, since most women find Tom Brady sexually attractive. If she didn't? Well, that just goes back to the very definition of rape.  If Tom Brady grabs a random woman's ass, she enjoys it. If she doesn't, it's because she didn't find him sexually attractive.  'But but but but, women can find a guy attractive without wanting to have sex with him!' Yeah, right. If we reverse the gender, we know this is bogus.   If a hot chick walks up to me and tries to 'rape' me, she couldn't do it. Not because I'm da man and so much stwonger than her, but because I would be fine with it.  'but but but but, imagine if she was trying to sodomize you with a broom handle after tying you up.' First of all, it still wouldn't be so bad, since at least it's a hot chick doing it. But the more important point here is that the vagina is a tough organ where the insertion of penises is no big deal. They pass fucking BABIES out this fucking thing.  The anus, on the other hand? Well, if a guy anally rapes a woman, maybe you have a bit more of a point.   Still, it comes down to the sexual attractiveness of the male. If it's prime Brad Pitt, she wants it in any orifice. If it's a sub-8, it's 'rape.'  And even if you say, 'oh, you're wrong, you despicable person who deserves to die alone for your opinions, you shirtlord. Rape is brutal, even if it's by a guy she is attracted to'...the fact of the matter is, even if a woman truly doesn't want sex in that moment, if the guy was sexually attractive, she will later reinterpret what happened and fantasize about it, and it will be the the hottest sex of her life, and she will desire rape simulations or something replicating the real thing for the rest of her life.  So long as it's with a Chad.	https://incels.is/threads/the-real-definitions-of-rape-and-sexual-assault.2558/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/the_real_definitions_of_rape_and_sexual_assault.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/the_real_definitions_of_rape_and_sexual_assault.tsv	1510953282	"The REAL definitions of ""rape"" and ""sexual assault"""	4	559	0

It is saying '96 percent of women who report rape or sexual assault in the NCVS were abused by men'. In other words, it is saying that the if a woman is raped, there's a 96% chance the rapist was a man. This makes sense because most humans are heterosexual, so if a woman is raped, it is usually by a man.  However that doesn't refute the fact that # of female rapists = # of male rapists.  This foid can barely even read! The article clearly stated juvenile correctional facilities, not women's prisons. Moreover, only a minority of the staff were women:  I also posted multiple articles. The foid conveniently excluded the most damning one: The gap is explainable to the fact men underreport rape because rape has historically always been treated as a crime against women only.   Conclusion: foid rape is widespread but ignored because of the gynocentric legal system.	https://incels.is/threads/it-proves-my-point-when-trying-to-deny-foids-are-rapists.412352/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_it_proves_my_point_when_trying_to_deny_foids_are_rapists.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_it_proves_my_point_when_trying_to_deny_foids_are_rapists.tsv	1663896648	JFL IT proves my point when trying to deny foids are rapists!	7	247	0

Horrible, countless atrocities(not just sexual) are commited on boys and men everyday, often by women. Men are the most raped, most homicide victims, most assaulted, violent crimes are commited against men more than women as a whole. Not to mention most suicides and work fatalities.

0	1663436620	Robert Hansen	I am honestly sick and tired of foids acting like rape is so bad and is the worst thing that can happen to them. I've literally seen some of them describe it as the worst thing that can happen to someone. I am writing this post after seeing one describe it one of the worst things that can happen to someone in a comment about that 4chan post where a guy broke up with his whore of a GF after he told her not to go the night club and she went anyway and got raped. People who describe rape in such a way are spitting in the faces of people that have actually gone through the worst things that have happened to people. You were slowly cooked alive in a brazen bull? Well that's not as bad as some foid being forcibly fucked by some guy that she didn't find attractive. You got skinned alive by some Mexican drug cartel? Being forced to have sex with some non chad is far worse, you got off easy. You were forced to watch your whole family get tortured and killed? Still not as bad as some non chad having his way with you without your consent. Do these people hear themselves. Your vagina being forcibly used by a non chad is nowhere near the worst thing that can happen to you you fucking cunt.  If someone gets assaulted as in they get severely beaten up, it's called assault, it's not seen as that bad, the assailant gets arrested and gets no more than a few years in jail and the victim is expected to get over it and they usually do. Some fuck is forced to fuck some non chad and it's called sexual assault and it's treated like the worst thing ever, the assailant gets a long prison sentence and other prisoners wanna hurt him.  A man could get beaten to within an inch of their life and it won't be seen as bad as some foid being forced to suck someone's dick. The world is fucked up and society is full of shit. The same people who act like a foid being raped is the worst thing ever are same people that will joke about us or other men they disagree with being raped in prison, then they justify it by saying we deserve it because of what we say about foids. Everyone on here hasn't actually ever harmed anyone and never will, but it's ok to make jokes about us being raped in prison because of what we say about foids. Because of fucking words. I bet the same people wouldn't make jokes about a foid that abused children getting raped. They'd most likely defend her and say she deserves prison and not to be raped, two wrongs don't make a right and blah blah blah. I could get raped in the asshole (a hole that wasn't designed for sex and would most definitely hurt more than a vaginal rape) and i'd probably get over it a lot sooner than a foid that was vaginally raped (a hole that was designed for sex and would hurt a lot less than being anally raped). Hell i bet i would even get over it sooner than a foid that was forced to suck someone's dick or better yet, had some guy stick their hand in their pants and touch their vagina. It's all because they think their vagina is special and one should get to touch or fuck unless they're some chad they allowed to and because they like the attention, they like to milk the sympathy and attention they get from being a 'rape victim'. I'm fucking sick of it. I'm sick of having to pretend like i give a shit about some foid getting raped and i have sympathy for her just to fit into this BS society. I recently had to do that at work when a co-worker was telling he about a female friend of his getting raped. I couldn't care less and had zero sympathy for her, but i had to put on an act once again.

Anthony Linder-Creo, 24, was charged with four counts of second-degree sexual assault and one count of second-degree endangering the welfare of a child.  It's alleged that Linder-Creo, a business teacher and multi-sport coach at Steinert High School, had sex with a 17-year-old student at his Robbinsville home in August.  Linder-Creo was arrested on Thursday and is being held in the Mercer County Correction Center pending a detention hearing.  Hamilton schools Superintendent Scott Rocco said that as soon as the school was made aware of the investigation, Linder-Creo was suspended and a 'termination of employment notice' was issued. The district fully cooperated with the investigation, according to Rocco.  'My paramount concern is the safety of our students. We have no tolerance for any actions that harm or could potentially harm our students,' Rocco said in a statement. 'All employees go through a background check which includes fingerprinting through the state, instructional certification through the state, interviews, and references.'  The superintendent stressed that it is important that members of the community contact the district when they believe there is a problem or they have a concern with an educator.  A high school and college basketball player​Linder-Creo played basketball with the Robbinsville Ravens until he graduated in 2015, [according to MidJersey.news](https://midjersey.news/2022/09/08/steinert-high-school-teacher-arrested-for-alleged-sexual-relations-with-a-17-year-old-female-student-at-his-home-in-robbinsville/).

0	1663603344	ScrewPassenger	Which of these two experiences is more damaging to the person: being sexually assaulted or being a manlet permavirgin? Well, as someone who's experienced sexual assault that borders on rape (a group of boys my age tackled me to the floor, dry humped me, and the few kids who saw it ridiculed me and tried to blackmail me by threatening they'd spread the word), my take is still that the latter is more soul-crushing.   Kinda bizarre when you see all the online stories about SA of similar severity and how it traumatized the victim for life and at the same time you see people saying that being an unfuckable permavirgin is at worst a mild inconvenience that shouldn't affect your well-being in the slightest. Something doesn't add up. When the word of my public humiliation died down I simply breathed a sigh of relief and was perfectly happy to go back to LDARing in peace. I barely thought about the incident since. But somehow, the state of inceldom, which is supposed to amount to literally nothing according to redditards is affecting me much more deeply. The answer is of course that different people can and will have different emotional response to the same situation.   Getting consensually fucked by your teacher as a teen student? For some it'll be a source of life-long trauma whereas for others it'll be a life-long confidence boost and a dream come true. Mocking someone for being fat? Some will take it in good spirt and join in on it, whereas someone else will develop an eating disorder and die. You can't look at a certain action or situation in isolation and objectively measure its' impact on the human being, that's a wrong way of thinking. Everyone will have a different emotional response to the same situation. That is also why you can't measure how someone else feels about something by simply putting yourself in their shoes, it doesn't give you the entire picture. When women hear about our struggles, they either think it's nothing or sometimes they're even envious because they'd apparently rather be ignored by the opposite sex altogether than pestered with low-tier dating offers. When we hear about them struggling with low-tier dating offers, we are envious of them because we'd much rather have that than radio silence.   Important to add: I don't think there's anything morally wrong with women not finding me attractive. This is one major difference when comparing sexual assault to the state of inceldom. I'm only comparing the emotional impact on the person on the receiving end, not making a moral judgement.	https://incels.is/threads/do-itfags-know-about-emotional-response-do-you.411157/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/do_itfags_know_about_emotional_response_do_you.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/do_itfags_know_about_emotional_response_do_you.tsv	1663603344	Do ITfags know about emotional response?

Her husband, who did freelance work for the school’s music department, found incriminating messages on Ortz’s iPad after coming home from a [recent trip to Florida and told the principal.](https://www.wtae.com/article/husband-discovered-school-choir-director-wifes-inappropriate-relationship-with-lawrence-county-student/40024149)  Ortz, of Hermitage, was suspended on May 9 and a warrant was issued for her arrest on Friday.  According to reports, she declined to immediately turn herself in and even sang in a local concert on Sunday before finally surrendering the following day.  Ortz’s predecessor as the school’s music director, Jonathan Priano, 37, is facing similar charges of sexual misconduct with students.  He allegedly had an affinity for tickling the feet of coeds and forming inappropriately close relationships with them, according to reports. His criminal case is pending.  Acting on tips from Ortz’s husband, investigators found more than 100 messages between the choir leader and her female student using Spotify’s chat function.  The pair allegedly had a code word in case their illicit dalliance was ever discovered.  In interviews with police, the student admitted to going to the teacher’s home when her spouse was away and that they had sex on several occasions.  The girl said she returned to Ortz’s home after her husband discovered their relationship to offer the teacher comfort, according to WTAE.  The teen defiantly told them that the pair were still communicating despite looming criminal charges for Ortz and that they are in love.   Ortz is being held in the Lawrence County lockup on $150,000 bond and her next hearing is set for May 25.  Priano, who faces 10 counts of sexual assault and two counts of unlawful contact with minors, had a pretrial hearing set for June.

In June 2020, The Fayette County Sherriff’s Department launched an investigation into a complaint made by a parent that discovered a message sent by Varner via Snapchat soliciting sex from the minor. The investigation uncovered additional crimes involving children that Varner had engaged in.  Authorities discovered that Varner would host social gatherings at his Hopewell residence, where he would supply minors with alcohol and engage in sexual activities with them. Additionally, the investigation determined that Varner had committed similar sexual offenses with minors in both Nicholas and Kanawha County.  Charges against Varner include soliciting a minor, sexual abuse by a parent, guardian, or custodian, and second and third-degree sexual assault. In addition to his 45-year sentence, the court ordered Varner to serve 40 years of extended supervised release upon discharging his sentence or completing parole.  Prosecuting Attorney Anthony Ciliberti Jr. prosecuted the case, and the Just for Kids Child Advocacy Center provided support services to the victims."	https://incels.is/threads/teachercel-sentenced-to-45-years-in-prison-for-banging-student.409235/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/teachercel_sentenced_to_45_years_in_prison_for_banging_student.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/teachercel_sentenced_to_45_years_in_prison_for_banging_student.tsv	1663122026	Teachercel sentenced to 45 years in prison for banging student	19	450	0

14	1663265938	ucw209	The concept of rape would be described by the instance of sexual encounter, where at least one of the parties didn't consent.  The real question is --- Are women or men (or any other type of human from any gender / age) actually capable of consenting to sex?  Ideally, a person's word is enough to determine whether or not they want to have sex. But based on how sexual assault have been historically handled by the justice system, its clearly not that simple.  A female can show her 'consent' by providing you with her word. But the next day she may wake up and become convinced that she was raped, due to the nature of the conditions under which she 'consented'. E.g. she felt pressured or coerced, or felt threatened, or she believes her mental state was unbalanced or altered in a way that made her less 'self-aware' or not in full control of her body at the time when she 'consented'.	https://incels.is/threads/is-rape-just-a-human-concept.403574/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_is_rape_just_a_human_concept.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_is_rape_just_a_human_concept.tsv	1661537047	Serious Is Rape Just a Human Concept?	21	418	14

13	1663159432	Sheogorath	 It wasn't sexual assault though because we liked it. In centuries past we had cute nannies we half-ascended with before we could even read and write, they literally tickled our balls because it made us happy and we went to sleep.

They wanted to make it only a felony if the perpetrator is a certain number of years older than the minor and they wanted statutory rape laws to be gender neutral, where male victims and female perpetrators were acknowledged by law. They wanted to make gender neutral laws, rape shield laws so the victim's sexual history was not brought up on trial, grading offenses by severity, and broadening offenses to acts outside penile-vaginal penetration, including other penetration, touching or oral activity (the last being particularly important when it comes to sexual assault of very young children). Feminists also wanted to eliminate the mistake-of-age defense where a man thought an underage girl was over the age of consent (even though that could happen). The drive for gender neutral language in statutory rape laws was successful in all states by 2000.

With 'yes means yes' any roaster can say a man fucked her without her saying yes first, and get him jailed for rape. They know foids won't be effected by these laws, so they don't mind making them as cucked as possible. They did that to not seem like hypocrits when they wanted to make it a felony and increase the definition of rape and sexual assault. They knew almost no foids will be effected by those laws, and if they are on rare occasions then cucked judges won't actually treat foids neutrally as men and give them the same long sentences.	https://incels.is/threads/statutory-rape-laws-used-to-only-punish-men-with-underage-girls-women-fucking-underage-guys-was-legal-until-the-end-of-the-20th-century.397048/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_statutory_rape_laws_used_to_only_punish_men_with_underage_girls_women_fucking_underage_guy.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_statutory_rape_laws_used_to_only_punish_men_with_underage_girls_women_fucking_underage_guy.tsv	1659748882	Blackpill Statutory rape laws used to only punish men with underage girls, women fucking underage guys was legal until the end of the 20th century.	18	472	15

The vast majority of rape instances are NOT about power, or at least very small part of the motive is gratification of overpowering.  If the former was true, then most rape 'victims' wouldn't be foids between the ages of 14-30. Once a female reaches 35 or so, her chances of sexual assault decrease by a certain percentage as every year passes. Why?  Because young fertile women are the most sexually desirable, hence why they get raped/molested the most, aside from dudes locked up in prisons.  If it was about power, or mostly about it, then older women who have more wealth, higher positions in companies and seniority would be assaulted way more. But that isn't the case.   TLDR  The 'Rape is about power' narrative has stuck with us for so long and proliferated in modern times, mostly because of women's sexual liberation, and their insatiable desire to express themselves sexually without abandon, nor consequence.  You can be a massive slut and nobody is suppose to fault you for eventually being fucked hard even if you have buyer's remorse the night after.  Women pre-sexual revolution, knew that being alone with a male that was a non-family member whom they had no intention of sleeping with, was generally something to be avoided. Let alone mixing alcohol, drugs, and skin-tight clothing into the mix.   Today it's all about pushing the boundaries of age-old common sense, and forgetting or ignoring the fact that males are largely opportunistic in their approach towards possible sex.	https://incels.is/threads/murder-is-more-common-than-rape.398979/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/jfl_murder_is_more_common_than_rape.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/jfl_murder_is_more_common_than_rape.tsv	1660325374	JFL Murder is more common than rape	11	390	11

If you are mid-tier or low-tier SMV with low social status, foids will almost certainly never approach first. You have to approach them and obtain their consent. In a civilized society that protects women, its only way for a mid-tier or low-tier male who desires sex with females. Deep down I hate it, because it means having to simp for them, but its the only civilized way for sub men with low social status to do it. The only alternatives are celibacy, or sexual assault which is illegal.  Also foids have more leverage due to higher demand in the sex market. Which means there's a lesser requirement for them to approach first.	https://incels.is/threads/why-are-we-supposed-to-approach-foids.407999/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_why_are_we_supposed_to_approach_foids.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_why_are_we_supposed_to_approach_foids.tsv	1662823389	RageFuel Why are we supposed to approach foids	26	389	8

0	1657424866	InMemoriam	South Korea didn’t have an incel election​All politicians exploit voters' grievances​   BY NAAMA KATES​Naama Kates is a writer, producer, and creator of the “[Incel](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/incel/id1469915971)' podcast.   Have incels been galvanised into political action? Will misogyny become central to democratic elections? These questions were being batted about last week as South Korea’s first “incel election” ended with Yoon Suk-yeol, the “incel candidate” from the conservative People Power Party winning.  The concept of the incel election first went viral a few months ago after a[ thoughtful piece by S. Nathan Park](https://unherd.com/2022/02/will-incels-decide-koreas-election/) described the influence of People Power Party’s Chairman Lee Jun-seok – a conservative pundit and “anti-feminist” – on young men, and the potential impact of this demographic on the presidential election. Subsequent articles speculated not only about whether this victory signifies the end of gender equality in South Korea, but whether this election is a harbinger of things to come.  But before everyone gets carried away, a corrective. This election has nothing to do with incels; the voters in question were probably not incels; misogyny is not unique to incels.  It stands to reason that the high rate of “sexlessness” in Korean adults – particularly young men, though it’s high across genders and age groups which is probably indicative of a nationwide unipolar depression — may very well alter people’s overall sense of well-being, fulfilment and belonging in the world, and thus, their political beliefs as well. But there is no evidence that the issue of sexlessness or celibacy played any role in this election. Despite their best efforts, not a single journalist was able to furnish a quote from anyone hoping to finally get laid under the Yoon administration. So we’re really not talking about an “incel movement” at all. And when a term has implicit associations with violent extremism, flippantly using it to describe a group of young men whose views one finds abhorrent is ill-advised.  Unfortunately, the term has become shorthand for exactly that: angry young men with bad political takes. These are men who feel marginalised, who don’t have families, who are struggling to find purpose and their place in life. Many of them are unemployed, underemployed, or struggling in school. In the West, they’re often described as white or working class, and they live in progressive, economically developed societies. They probably also live in a society where income inequality is growing and unemployment rates are high.  That profile fits for incels, at least for the media’s portrayal of them, and it fits for the Proud Boys, and the Oath Keepers, and also for extremists on the far Left – such as Antifa’s Black Bloc. Details about race and class vary depending on the cultural context, but the fact that young men with nothing to lose is the demographic most likely to embrace a radical or subversive new political ideology is consistently true, and it has been throughout history.  In The True Believer, published in 1951, Eric Hoffer brilliantly described the conditions that compelled people to join “mass movements” of social or political protest with Twenties Germany as the backdrop. Mass movements appeal to people who feel powerless and unappreciated in their lives and who tend to externalise their frustrations rather than looking inward. The group most likely to embrace a radical new ideology is one Hoffer called the New Poor, who may in fact be middle class, but perceive a recent loss in income, social status, or security that was out of their control.  Hoffer’s account was written in response to the turn toward Communism and Fascism, but extreme or subversive political movements have been drawing in a new crop of New Poor with remarkable agility over the past decade, with the aid of technology. Social media and alternative platforms have given independent content creators and their ideas exposure to a global audience of like-minded fans who can instantly communicate with each other. These platforms have also contributed to and benefited from a climate of hyperpolarisation by promoting provocative, contentious speech.  Indeed, most of the “anti-feminist” ideas espoused by Yoon and his supporters during the campaign should be instantly recognisable to anyone familiar with the online ecosystem known as the Intellectual Dark Web, or the Manosphere, or parts of the Alt-Right: the advantages of social programming and affirmative action in favour of women, the suggestion that the pay gap is not real but the result of women’s lesser contributions, the issue of false reporting of sex crimes, the fact that men are conscripted for military service.  When applied to the United States, some of these arguments may seem exaggerated — but they do have an essence of truth. Data about rates of false reporting are inconsistent, but it does occur, despite #MeToo’s directive to “Believe women”. Family courts often rule in favour of women; the criminal justice system gives men harsher sentences for comparable crimes. These facts are generally ignored by feminists and frequently cited by their opponents.  Anti-feminism, like the other identitarian ideologies that have risen to popularity over the past decade, is characterised primarily by feelings of victimhood experienced by the in-group, and hostility toward the structural powers and privileges afforded the out-group — rather than actual hostility toward members of that group, as in overt misogyny. Anti-feminist groups are not necessarily misogynists for suggesting that if equality is the goal, then it might be time for men to get a push in some areas. Thanks to gains made by feminists in the latter half of the last century, women are outperforming men in many areas where they once lagged behind, or were not even allowed entry, such as higher education, where women currently comprise 60% of students. [UWSL]Whether this is due to an inherent difference between the sexes that allows women to better utilise certain aspects of the system, or a structural difference that directly benefits them more is an interesting question, but it’s ultimately irrelevant. [/UWSL]When the current system similarly favours men, we rightly recognise it as sexist, and wouldn’t call its opponents “incels”.  Of course, in South Korea, where the deeply patriarchal society is already much more divided along the gender line, anti-feminist talking points don’t land the same way. The country has a 35% pay gap between men and women, and is ranked lowest among the 38 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on the “Glass Ceiling Index”. Two years ago, police uncovered a widespread network for trading non-consensual sexual images over Telegram, and Park Won-soon, the mayor of Seoul, died in a probable suicide amid rumors of sexual harassment complaint against him. [UWSL]Most troubling of all is the fact that despite a very low overall homicide rate, women in South Korea represent more than half of the victims, in stark contrast to the international average of 21%. H[/UWSL]igh-profile events and statistics like these sit uncomfortably alongside tirades about how the wage gap and most sexual assault reports are all fake news.  Over the past six or seven years, populist candidates have been exploiting the grievances of young men all over the world, often with traditionalist messages that are underpinned by anti-feminist ideas. This resonates, in part, because most young people have issues with dating and the opposite sex, and unhappy young men almost certainly do. In Western countries with large immigrant populations, race and immigration are more potent issues than gender, partly because these countries have always had more equality between the sexes than traditionally Confucian South Korea, which has virtually no immigrant population, and where the reverse is true.  President Yoon is married and is certainly not an incel, and probably doesn’t really much care for this. But politicians opportunistically exploit the deeply held grievances of their constituents, appeal to their basest impulses, fears and prejudices. Not as a matter of ideology, but of political expediency. So Yoon pledged to abolish the Ministry of Gender Equality and Family in his campaign, which is unlikely to happen in a democracy like South Korea without a lot of bureaucratic gridlock, and even if it does, it’s unclear what programs would actually be affected or how. But, then, even his liberal opponent promised to remove the word “Women” from the Department’s official name.  Right now, though, there are more important issues to consider. Yoon, who was a prosecutor for 27 years and has no previous experience in politics, has voiced strong opinions about issues of foreign policy, expressing a hard line on North Korea, and a stronger alliance with the United States than with China, compared with the more diplomatic position taken by the previous administration that his liberal rival pledged to continue. Given the war in Ukraine, and current tensions with China, his position has been praised by the Washington Post as “a welcome turn toward the US”, and the Wall Street Journal as “an opportunity for closer security ties between Seoul and Washington”. Maybe in light of the recent eruption of conflict on the world stage, it is more important to focus on the foreign policy of the new “incel” president, rather than jumping to the conclusion that stunts from his campaign trail are putting human rights under threat.	https://incels.is/threads/south-korea-didnt-have-an-incel-election.389602/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/teehee_south_korea_didnt_have_an_incel_election.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/teehee_south_korea_didnt_have_an_incel_election.tsv	1657424866	TeeHee South Korea didn’t have an incel election	5	1K	0
0	1655698927	Edmund_Kemper	"I decided to make a list of many myths people believe about romantically/sexually inexperienced people. Many people believe in these myths and I am here to debunk them all.  Myth 1: There are zero virgins left after a certain age (e.g. 18 or 21 or 25 or something)  Many people believe this myth. Nope. There are still virgins after 18 or 21, etc. Most people think almost everyone (95%) loses their virginity by the age of 18 and that 100% of people have by the age of 21 or so. Many people think there couldn't be any virgins at 25 or 30. If you're that age and you tell people you're a virgin they won't even believe you sometimes.  Unfortunately, the CDC didn't make any new surveys figuring out how many people are a virgin as of 2022 (recent years). According to the [CDC data from 2006-2008](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr036.pdf), of men ages 25-29, 3.8% have never had any sexual contact with the opposite sex, and 3.1% of men ages 30-34 haven't. 1.3% of men ages 35-39 and 1.2% of men in their early 40s haven't. This is compared to 3.4% of women ages 25-29 being virgins, 1.9% of women in ages 30-34 being virgins, and 0.4% of women in their early 40s being virgins. Prevalence varies, with some [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marie-Aude-Boislard/publication/337065507_Why_Do_Socially_Withdrawn_Children_Tend_to_Become_Heterosexually_Active_Later_than_Their_Peers_A_Mediation_Model/links/5dde77fe92851c83644bf97e/Why-Do-Socially-Withdrawn-Children-Tend-to-Become-Heterosexually-Active-Later-than-Their-Peers-A-Mediation-Model.pdf) showing that 5% of men at 25 and 3% of women that age are virgins. In fact, [in the UK](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5696417/Virgin-numbers-rise-UK-fear-intimacy.html), they found 12.5% of 26 year olds are now virgins and that virginity was more common in recent years, but almost 80% lost it by age 19. According to CDC in 2006-2008, 12% of women and 14% of men age 20-24 were virgins, so this is like prevalence of left-handedness. These percents might be higher because many virgins don't admit they're virgins.  Guess what? [Less than 3% of YOUNG people](https://research.lifeway.com/2019/04/15/how-many-americans-actually-identify-as-lgbt-less-than-you-think/) (they're more likely to admit it and most are pro-gay) identify as gay or lesbian, which remained stable in the past few decades while the percent admitting to being bisexual skyrocketed. In [2022](https://news.gallup.com/poll/389792/lgbt-identification-ticks-up.aspx), only 2.5% of Generation Z reported being gay and 2% were lesbians. 15% were bisexual, while other generations were way less likely to admit to being bi. Just 2.1% said they're trans. In May 2022, [on pew research polls](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/06/07/about-5-of-young-adults-in-the-u-s-say-their-gender-is-different-from-their-sex-assigned-at-birth/), 2% of young adults said they're trans and 3% said they're non-binary.  So, the odds of meeting an adult virgins in their mid-20s or older are like the odds of being a gay person or trans person. Admittedly these percentages for gay or trans people could be higher because they won't admit it but the same could be true for virgins. Also, these people who admit it could be ones who are out of the closet, so it could be maybe like the odds of meeting an openly gay or trans person (although many closet ones might admit it in anonymous surveys too). Nonetheless, most gays and lesbians are out of the closet, unlike bisexuals. Maybe that's why the percentage of young people identifying as gay didn't skyrocket much in recent decades unlike the percentage of young people identifying as bi. [75% of gays/lesbians said all or most people important to them in real life know their sexual orientation](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/06/18/bisexual-adults-are-far-less-likely-than-gay-men-and-lesbians-to-be-out-to-the-people-in-their-lives/), compared to only19% of bisexuals. Only 23% of bisexuals said SOME knew. Only 11% of gay people came out to a few or none of them, compared to 57% of bisexuals. So it could be most gay people are honestly about admitting they're gay in polls unless they're a gay elder.  Myth 2: If a man is a virgin or never could find a girlfriend, it means his standards arec too high or he only goes after supermodels or women 'out of his league'.  Quite the opposite actually. In fact, MANY people like to assume this about virgin men, but just because many people say this is true about them, doesn't mean it's true (why do you think the word 'myth' exists?). Any anecdote 'proving' this is common isn't valid evidence (contrary to what many people think, anecdotes aren't valid evidence and are often unverifiable). Even if you have met virgin guys who only want supermodels, you probably met MANY MORE who didn't. You probably don't remember them because they aren't as noteworthy or because they never even told you they're inexperienced.  This study shows it's a myth. [Link to study here](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Michaela-Pfundmair/publication/346028551_Oxytocin_makes_inexperienced_men_more_selective_in_their_dating_strategy/links/5fb774ff458515b797559581/Oxytocin-makes-inexperienced-men-more-selective-in-their-dating-strategy.pdf).  110 volunteers with 47 male and 63 female (mean age=22.36 years, SD=3.64) (the vast majority of them were heterosexual) participated in this study.  Next paragraph right below but read this: according to the methodology, they wanted to use average-looking people because it's the best way to measure how high a person's standards can be (because many people get attracted to conventionally attractive people but not many like ugly people. Apparently, women are more conventionally attractive than men on average:   			{ 				'lightbox_close': 'Close', 				'lightbox_next': 'Next', 				'lightbox_previous': 'Previous', 				'lightbox_error': 'The requested content cannot be loaded.

Oxytocin made inexperienced men more selective. Inexperienced men were more romantically interested in medium attractiveness women than experienced men. In other words, they were less selective than experienced men. With oxytocin, inexperienced men were only slightly less interested romantically in medium attractiveness women than experienced men (in other words: only slightly more selective). When it came to romantic interest, oxytocin made both experienced and inexperienced men more selective, especially inexperienced men. It reduced romantic interest for both types of men, especially inexperienced men. Inexperienced men had more sexual interest in medium attractiveness women than experienced men, but less sexual interest in medium attractiveness women than experienced men when the men all were taking oxytocin. Oxytocin reduced sexual interest in inexperienced men but did not affect sexual interest in experienced men. In short, inexperienced men are less selective than experienced men, but are slightly more selective and officially more selective than experienced men when it comes to oxytocin. Inexperienced men have their romantic/sexual interest reduced with oxytocin.  On the other hand, inexperienced women were slightly less romantically interested in medium-attractiveness men than experienced women, therefore slightly more picky than experienced women. Under oxytocin, however, they were officially more romantically interested in medium attractiveness men than experienced women (AKA less selective than experienced women). Oxytocin increased romantic interest in inexperienced women but decreased romantic interest in experienced women. When it came to sexual interest, they were a little less sexually interested in medium attractiveness men than experienced women (AKA a little pickier than experienced women), but officially more sexually interested in medium attractiveness men than experienced women when both were under oxytocin (AKA less picky than experienced women). Oxytocin reduced sexual interest in experienced women but slightly increased sexual interest in inexperienced women. In short, inexperienced women are a little pickier than experienced women romantically/sexually but less picky than experienced women romantically/sexually when it comes oxytocin. Oxytocin increased interest levels in inexperienced women but reduced interest levels in experienced women.  Men had more romantic interest in average looking women than women did in average looking men (although inexperienced women but notexperienced women had just as much romantic interest as men in average-looking people of the opposite sex). When it came to sexual interest, both experienced men and inexperienced men were both more sexually interested in the opposite sex's average looking women than women (both experienced and inexperienced) were sexually interested in average-looking men regardless of oxytocin.  Are there virgin men who struggle to find a girlfriend who only want supermodels? Sure, but it's rare. And men who chase after supermodels might not necessarily be inexperienced with relationships or sex. It could be there were times where they did find an average-looking girlfriend because they personally found her very attractive or maybe they found a conventionally attractive woman as a girlfriend and had luck.  Myth 3: Virgins are clingy  Many people believe this about virgins, and no, it isn't often true. In fact, it's really patronizing when people say 'I won't date a virgin because it's a huge responsibility taking someone's virginity and they might be clingy'. This type of attitude towards virgins is quite common. It's like they think they can dictate what you emotionally can or cannot handle or what your behavior should be like just because of your mere level of experience.  No, virgins aren't particularly clingy, and this stereotype is especially ascribed to virgin women. But it isn't true for virgin women nor virgin men for that matter.  In multiple studies, they measured the love styles of inexperienced people, sexually experienced people and sexually coercive people. They looked at both men and women.   [Study 1](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0886260502017003003?casa_token=wr1Ajv_ifdYAAAAA:gZG8v8ubZf6Tq-nilaNJYPHRQ37bZX-ZPSEqknYrnYh8q7782HlPfIDyuQ8GpOJ9L3z4xw1yB9hBPw)  173 university men at a private Midwestern university were recruited and the average age was 20.94 (SD=3.48). 46 of the men were inexperienced (26.6%), 62 of them (35.8%) were sexually experienced but no coercive and 63 of them (36.4%) were sexually coercive because they have engaged in sexual coercion or violence at least once.  One can measure clinginess perhaps by looking at love styles, which is a person's idea of what a relationship should be like. They were asked to describe their love styles, and these are the results:    Virgin men scored highest on agape and sexually coercive men scored lowest (but still scored quite high), which emphasizes unconditional love and caring for a person. Ludus was a manipulative form of love style focusing on deception, low commitment, and playful teasing. They might womanize too. Sexually inexperienced scored higher on it than experienced men but not nearly as high as coercive men, so this doesn't signal manipulative or womanizing behavior from virgin men. Virgin men scored lowest on Eros while experienced, non-coercive men scored highest, but all scored quite high. Eros was particularly clingy and emphasized extremely passionate love focusing on deepening the relationship.  [Study 2](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1023/A:1013016502745.pdf)  In a sample of 185 college women (mean age=21.02, SD=5.21) at a private midwestern university, they classified them into three groups: virgin (27%), sexually experienced but not coercive (54%), and sexually coercive (18.2%). Measuring their love style attachments, they found this:  Admittedly, they scored higher on Mania than experienced women but not as high as coercive women, and that gap could've been bigger anyways. but they scored lower than the other 2 groups on Eros. They don't appear to be particularly clingy then.  [Study 3](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1300/J056v06n01_06)  123 college men (mean age=19.6, SD=1.33) were in a study. Two-thirds were freshmen or sophomores. 20% were virgins, 34% were coercive, and 46% were experienced but non-coercive. Here are the results when looking at their ideas of what relationships should be like:    Eros and Mania are clingy lovestyles, especially mania. They admittedly scored higher on mania, but that gap could've been way bigger, but scored lowest on Eros and lowest on Ludus (so they clearly aren't predatory).  They scored highest on 'when my lover gets too dependent on me, I want to back off a little.', which shows they aren't clingy. They didn't score that high on predatory statements, sometimes really low.  They scored lowest on secure attachment style but that could be due to relationship inexperience and thus fearing what the first relationship would be like. They scored high on avoidant attachment style which is anti-clingy. They scored lowest, however, on anxious/ambivalent, so they aren't needy.  They scored lowest on trust in what their idea of relationships and/or their actual experiences in relationships are like, but this could be due to inexperience with relationships and thus anxiety over experiencing it the first time. They scored higher on fear of closeness which is anti-clingy. They scored lowest on jealousy. They admittedly scored higher on obsessive preoccupation but the gap could've been bigger.  So they don't appear to be particularly clingy, at least not too much. But remember, studies on this could vary.  In fact, while we all hear about virgins who cling, we got to realize that virgins who don't cling aren't anything remarkable of a good gossip story so we don't hear stories about virgins who don't cling. Anecdotes, however, aren't valid evidence and anecdotes can vary and won't necessarily represent what is typically true.  It could be that many virgins cling, but it could be age that causes it, not virginity per se. According to this [article](https://www.datingadvice.com/for-women/will-men-date-older-virgins), which explains it perfectly: So it could be that virgins might cling because many are teenagers and teens tend to be emotional and full of puppy love, and thus would cling after losing their virginity, but not all teens necessarily cling after virginity loss and clinginess isn't necessarily long-term.  A person you take the virginity of isn't going to think of you the rest of your life or their life because you took their virginity. Do you think all day about your first partner? Probably not, so this shouldn't be different.  In fact, [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/K-Harden/publication/231211975_True_Love_Waits_A_Sibling-Comparison_Study_of_Age_at_First_Sexual_Intercourse_and_Romantic_Relationships_in_Young_Adulthood/links/566077e408ae4931cd597d6b/True-Love-Waits-A-Sibling-Comparison-Study-of-Age-at-First-Sexual-Intercourse-and-Romantic-Relationships-in-Young-Adulthood.pdf) show that those who lose their virginity late (after age 19) tend to report MUCH better relationships in young adulthood. They had MUCH more satisfactory relationships. Sounds like virgins aren't necessarily clingy and can be good significant others.  So, this idea of virgins being clingy or taking their virginity will be dangerous is stupid and patronizing, and it infantilizes them by portraying them as 'manchildren' or 'womanchildren' who cannot distinguish love from sex. People portray virgins as still mentally children and unable to distinguish the two. You are acting like you can dictate what they can or cannot handle or be ready for or what their behavior or sexuality is like based off their mere level of experience. This is not only bullshit but it is patronizing and subtle virgin shaming. Are there virgins over 18 who cling? Sure, but is it more common among them than among experienced people? No. Besides, there could be experienced people who are clingy anyways.  Myth 4: People who lack relationship experience will be bad with relationships.  Actually, the study two paragraphs above shows that those who lose their virginity late (after age 19) report MUCH better relationships in young adulthood with much more satisfaction. These people had less romantic partners than people who started as a teen and about 60% of them never dated as a teenager. Relationships are about communication, and as long as you're good with communication, you're good with relationships, regardless of 'experience'. There are some subjects in life that you get better with through experience depending on the characteristics of the subject and how it works, like karate or singing, but relationships aren't one of them.  Myth 5: If a man is a virgin, he was a reject who no woman wanted but if a woman is a virgin, she is simply waiting until marriage.  This is why virgin women are labeled a tease or a prude or why virgin men are labeled losers. I think this assumption exists because men pursue, women get pursued. Men are expected to be the initiators and thus are expected to do everything they can to find a sexual partner. Women were the pursued, and are expected to be the gatekeepers. Although virgin women are stigmatized too now and women who have premarital sex are now seen as normal, historically, women were expected to wait until marriage but not men (men thus would get with hookers). People think if a woman is a virgin, she must've been pursued by many men already and is saving herself for someone special and is old-fashioned. Men were always expected to pursue or be initiators of sex, so people assume he tried to find a partner and no woman wanted him. The idea of a man waiting until marriage is implausible to many people because men were expected to do whatever they can to have sex. Women who wait until marriage are seen as old-school because nowadays, everyone is expected to have premarital sex. Long ago, only women were expected to wait until marriage. Men weren't except maybe in some religious families if anything.  Admittedly, it is uncommon for virgin women to be involuntary virgins (virgins who simply never had the opportunity) and it is quite common for virgin men to be involuntary virgins. Nonetheless, it's just as common for virgin men to be voluntary virgins and there are a minority of virgin women who simply never had the opportunity. In the study '[Virgins at Age 26: Who Are They?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34404502/)', they found that among virgins at age 26 in Switzerland, 47.2% of virgin men said they had not had the occasion compared to just 15.5% of virgin women. Most virgin women were virgins by choice. 45.9% never found the right person, 10.3% were virgins for religious/morla reasons, 19% are waiting until marriage, 5.9% were not emotionally ready and 0.6% wanted to wait until they're older. Many men were virgins by choice though. 18.6% did not find the right person, 10.9% are abstaining from sex for religious/moral reasons, 12.8% are waiting until marriage, and 3.2% are not emotionally ready. Some men are virgins by choice and some not by choice, it's half-and-half. Involuntary virgin women were relatively uncommon. Nonetheless, both exist, but voluntary virgin men are way more common than involuntary virgin women.  Myth 6: Virgin men are more misogynistic (or misogynistic men are often virgins bitter they don't have sex).  Quite the opposite actually. It's really rare for misogynistic men to be virgins, and the vast majority of virgin men, including the involuntary ones, aren't misogynists.   In a [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6224861/pdf/main.pdf) of 2,703 teenagers in Spain ages 14 to 20 (M=15.89; SD=1.29), including 1,350 teenage boys (M = 15.95; SD = 1.30) and 1,353 teenage girls (M = 15.83; SD = 1.28), researchers found a very strong correlation between sexism and sexual and romantic success. The study revealed that sexually active teenage boys have more benevolent sexism, more hostile sexism, and more ambivalent sexism than non-sexually active teenage boys. Additionally, benevolently sexist men had their first sex at an earlier age and hostile sexist men had a lower proportion of condom use. The study also revealed that women are attracted to benevolently sexist men. The study revealed that teenage boys without sexual experience had the least amount of hostile sexism, benevolent sexism and ambivalent sexism. Boys with non-penetrative sexual experience had more of the three types of sexism, and boys with penetrative sexual experience had the most amount of the three types of sexism.   Another [study](https://europepmc.org/backend/ptpmcrender.fcgi?accid=PMC4842162&blobtype=pdf) took 555 men ages 18 to 25 (mean age=20.6, standard deviation=2.1) and had them fill out surveys testing them on how misogynistic they are, how much they adhere to traditional masculine stereotypes, and other characteristics. They had discovered that misogynistic men (N=44) had more one-night stands, significantly more sex partners, watched more pornography, committed more sexual assault and intimate partner violence, were more likely to pay for sexual services (43% of misogynistic men have paid for sexual services before), and often were involved in fraternities (58%), sports teams (86%), and intramural sports (84%). Misogynistic were compared and contrasted with normative men, normative men involved in male activities or groups, and sex focused men (men who engaged in an exceptionally large amount of sexual activity but are not necessarily misogynistic).  The researchers state: As you can see here, misogynistic men aren't a bunch of virgins bitter they never have sex or relationships. They usually are hypermasculine, promiscuous womanizers who are interested in hypermasculine activities such as frats, sports, porn and promiscuity.  Rapists tend to be highly sexually experienced men.  Rapists often were found to have misogynistic or hostile attitudes towards women, and misogynistic men were far more likely to commit sexual assault. Rapists DO have consensual sex. In fact, [studies](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077801298004006006) [have](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624X08316711) [consistently](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10508-013-0243-5.pdf) [shown](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neil-Malamuth/publication/21199598_Characteristics_of_Aggressors_Against_Women_Testing_a_Model_Using_a_National_Sample_of_College_Students/links/00b7d5217c31b25bde000000/Characteristics-of-Aggressors-Against-Women-Testing-a-Model-Using-a-National-Sample-of-College-Students.pdf) that rapists typically have far more consensual sex partners than other men, more dating partners, more one night stands, lose their virginity earlier than other men and begin dating at an earlier age than other men. [Men with unrestricted sociosexuality](https://web.archive.org/web/20170617172038/https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/articles/16817063/) (positive attitudes and behaviors endorsing promiscuity or casual sex, etc.) were found to be more sexually active, have more frequent sex, lose their virginity early and had far more sex partners, and they were found to have adversarial sexual beliefs, conservative attitudes about women, high rape myth acceptance, and past sexual aggression.  In the book Rape Investigation Handbook by John O. Savino and Brent E. Turvey, they showed studies showing how many rapists attract women and are sexually active with many women. 'Groth (1979, p. 5) dispels the myth of the predominance of 'loner' and socially outcast rapists by explaining that 'one third of the offenders that we worked with were married and sexually active with their wives at the time of their assaults. . . . Of those offenders who were not married (that is, single, seperated, or divorced), the majority were actively involved in a variety of consenting sexual relationships with other persons at the time of their offenses.' Also, 'furthermore, Groth and Hobson (1983, p. 161), who studied 1,000 offenders over a 16-year period, found the following: 'All of the offenders we have seen were sexually active males involved in consensual relationships at the time of their offense. No one raped because he had no other outlet for his sexual needs.'  No link between male virginity and misogyny or violence.  Studies have found no link between male virginity and misogyny.  In a [survey](https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED267321.pdf) of 2,972 college men from a nationwide, quasi-random sample of college classes from 32 universities, of all the men who admitted to committing acts that met the definition of rape (84% of the men who admitted to rape believed they were not a rapist at all), just 12% were virgins, with the average age of the rapists at the time of the rape being 18.5. This is a low percentage and at 18, virginity is not as unusual compared to later on in life. Admittedly, 33% of men who attempted rape were virgins. Nonetheless, these were college men and these men were in a time period of life where virginity is less rare compared to later in life. Besides, it could be because virgin men often don't know how to have sex or the anatomy of the vulva and thus it could become an attempted instead of completed rape. Nonetheless, a majority of attempted rapists (67%) were not virgins.  In a [sample](https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1125&context=psychfacpub) of 304 male college students ages 19 to 46 with an average age of 21.3 (SD = 2.87), of all the college men who admitted to committing sexual aggression, only 1 was a virgin and virgin men comprised 46.3% of the non-violent group of men. The non-violent men scored lower than the sexually violent men in terms of hostility toward women, acceptance of interpersonal violence, and rape proclivity, and the virgin men in the non-violent group did not differ in any variables (not even hostility toward women, acceptance of interpersonal violence, and rape proclivity) from the sexually experienced men who were also non-violent. This means virgin men were no more likely than other men to be misogynistic, accepting of interpersonal violence or prone to rape.  In a [sample](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1016/S0162-3095(96)00076-3) of 136 men ages 17 to 36 (Mean age = 20.5, SD = 2.6), they found that while sexually coercive men had more sexual experiences and higher self-perceived mating success, they found that sexually inexperienced men had a low likelihood to commit sexual violence, less preference for casual sex and partner variety, and less antisocial tendencies.  In a [study](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF01541973.pdf) of 191 college men (mean age = 19.1) including 23 virgin men (12% of the sample), virgin men scored lower than sexually experienced men and sexually aggressive men on willingness or acceptance toward using exploitation or force on a woman sexually. Virgin men also scored lower on being aroused by the idea of raping or committing sexual coercion against a woman and getting away with it, including scoring lower on the hate, sex, or power aspects of raping or committing sexual coercion against women.  In a [sample](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112751/pdf/nihms435476.pdf) of college students, it was found that virgin men scored lower than non-virgin men on the Sexual Narcissism Scale, including exploitation (e.g.: “I could easily convince an unwilling partner to have sex with me”), entitlement (e.g.: “I should be permitted to have sex whenever I want it”, and skill (e.g.: “I really know how to please a partner sexually”). Among women, virgin women scored higher on exploitation but scored slightly lower on entitlement and much lower on skill compared to non-virgin women. Nonetheless, both virgin and non-virgin men scored higher than virgin and non-virgin women on exploitation and entitlement, so this does not suggest virgin women are high on sexual narcissism. Additionally, despite virgin men scoring lower than non-virgin men on the overall Sexual Narcissism Scale and virgin women scoring higher than non-virgin women, both virgin men and virgin women scored higher than non-virgin men and women on low empathy (e.g.: “The feelings of my sexual partners don’t usually concern me”). This could be, however, due to lack their sexual experience making them not know about communication during sex rather than lack of morals or hostility toward the opposite sex. Although sexual narcissism was significantly associated with sexual aggression and coercion among non-virgins, it was not significantly associated with sexual aggression and coercion among virgins.  Admittedly, in [one sample](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1177/088626097012003005) of 65 men with a mean age of 19.9 years (SD = 1.3), of the 15 virgin men, the virgin men reported more attraction to sexual aggression (M = 12.40) than the experienced men (M = 7.98). Nonetheless, the sample size of virgin men was small and aforementioned studies showed results indicating the opposite finding.  Admittedly, these studies typically sample men who are often around 18 to 21 years old, which is not a later-in-life virgin, but these findings are still noteworthy and still study young adults rather than teenage minors (it is much more common for teenage minors to be virgins). Additionally, [many Incels.is users](https://incels.is/threads/survey-results-oct-2019.147774/) are often between the ages of 18 and 25, with many being 18 to 21, identical to this age group. [Furthermore](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marie-Aude-Boislard/publication/308663257_Trajectories_of_Annual_Number_of_Sexual_Partners_from_Adolescence_to_Emerging_Adulthood_Individual_and_Family_Predictors/links/59ed333f0f7e9bfdeb71ade7/Trajectories-of-Annual-Number-of-Sexual-Partners-from-Adolescence-to-Emerging-Adulthood-Individual-and-Family-Predictors.pdf), people who are virgins or who have a low number of sexual partners by young adulthood engage in less antisocial behaviors as adolescents (Contrary to popular belief, antisocial doesn't mean socially withdrawn or introverted. That's being asocial. Antisocial means lacking empathy and violating the rights of others, being characteristic of antisocial personality disorder.).  Misogynistic men aren't usually virgins. The Internet and social media likes to emphasize ones who are (e.g.: incels who believe in the blackpill philosophy and men with 'nice guy syndrome'). Nonetheless, these men are rare. Social media likes to emphasize them so much that it makes them seem more common than they really are. For example, most people probably didn't know what 'nice guy syndrome' was until the Internet told them about it. In fact, 'nice guy syndrome' is just some overly nice, excessively attentive guy who gets frustrated from consistent rejections and then concludes that women didn't want him because he's nice and only want jerks after seeing himself fail to find a girlfriend and watching violent men or domestic abusers have girlfriends. It isn't just any guy, no matter how nice he claims to be or no matter how successful at dating he is, who is simply being nice to get sex as a reward. In fact, most overly nice, excessively attentive men probably don't have nice guy syndrome. Also, before the Internet had an obsession with nice guy syndrome, the definition of a nice guy was simply an overly nice, unassertive guy who got bullied and taken advantage of by people because he's too nice and women found him unattractive because they consider him a pushover. It wasn't until the 2010s when the Internet changed the definition because of these guys they detected who really only exist on the Internet. In fact, 90% of the time when i hear about nice guy syndrome online, it's just the Internet complaining about them rather than me actually seeing one. And r/niceguys is a karmawhore subreddit. Those text message conversations on there show the same fuckin thing each time and sometimes really satirical conversations. I won't be shocked if at least half those conversations were fake and just some friend they hired to feign nice guy syndrome for karma points. Same could be true for r/creepyPMs. In fact, many of those guys featured on r/niceguys might not have nice guy syndrome. They might say 'why are you ignoring me? I'm just being nice' in the text message conversation when she ignores them or shows disinterest, but that doesn't signal nice guy syndrome. He could be taking her disinterest personally and could be saying that to disarm her because he thinks disinterest means she hates him or something. Maybe that's why they called themselves nice. The idea of being a nice guy and women going after jerks doesn't necessarily enter these guys' heads. There's a lot of ambiguity. If these guys said: 'how dare you ignore me! You probably only like jerks instead of nice guys like me who will treat you right', then yeah, that's nice guy syndrome. In fact, we don't know the backgrounds of any guys on r/niceguys screenshots who send those messages. They could be very romantically/sexually experienced regardless of whether they get rejected or get mad because of rejection (which doesn't mean they are inexperienced). All we see is a mere unverifiable text message conversation that could be fake for karma points. The earliest mention of nice guys who conclude women only like jerks goes back to 2002 with a blog post condemning them by Heartless Bitches International. Even back then, the Internet rarely spoke about these guys (this changed in the 2010s thanks to subreddits like r/niceguys).  So yeah, 90% or more of us wouldn't even know what nice guy syndrome is if it wasn't for the Internet always complaining about them, and virtually ever time I hear about them online, it's just people online complaining about nice guys than me actually seeing one. The Internet has an odd obsession with them and I think it's because the Internet needs a group of people they can ridicule for kicks and because nice guys purportedly lack romantic/sexual success and men who struggle to attract women are heavily stigmatized and because these guys criticize women and because men who criticize women are hated by society, nice guys are an easy target for ridicule. I think that's why the Internet has an obsession with them. And neckbeards and fedora hats? I'm sure most nice guys don't look like that (they probably look like ordinary guys). Hardly anybody wears fedora hats nowadays (this isn't the 1950s) and neckbeards are unusual (most guys have stubble beards not neckbeards now, and mustaches are coming back in style).   As for incels on this forum? Well, incel means involuntary celibacy. I guess we could call blackpilled incels 'blincels' (blackpill+incels). For the sake of this thread, we'll call them blincels. Blincels aren't just any misogynistic virgin. Not all misogynistic virgins will necessarily know about the blackpill or even the word 'incel' itself. Notice how people on blincel forums tend to believe in the blackpill? I wouldn't call Elliot Rodger the same as people on this forum. He was practically REDPILLED. He believed dressing in certain clothes, making lots of money at the lottery, etc. would help him attract women. He isn't blackpilled. He would've been hated on here for saying that Asians and Indians have it easy getting white girlfriends. He would've been banned for bragging about his looks (which he did a lot) and for racebaiting or expressing redpilled beliefs about moneymaxxing or clothesmaxxing. He's a proto-blincel given that people on this forum often talk about him (although contrary to what the media says, not everyone here likes him, and many don't like him). If he joined here, even people who like him would've hated him.  Blincels are involuntarily celibate men who believe in the blackpill, and they hate women and even just humans in general. In fact, people here hate literally men too. Average men are normies. Attractive men are chads. Men who marry are betabuxxers. Men who disagree with us are cucks. Virgin men who disagree with us (most virgin men would hate us) are incels in denial. Anyone here who isn't short and ugly and ethnic is a fakecel (so we hate our own fellow members of the forum). People here only approve of men who are involuntarily celibate AND who hate women and humans in general and who also believe in the blackpill AND who also are short and ugly. Only 0.1% of men at most will fulfill all those expectations, so almost every man on Earth is hated by people on here.  We only have like 10,000 members, most of who are banned forever or inactive (most people here within 1 or 2 years get permabanned or just leave the forum). We have 150 users a day, often the same people each time, and the 1,000 visitors a day are often IncelTear members or curious observants who don't necessarily agree with us. IncelTear has way more members and active users than us.  So yeah, you can't know what misogynistic men are like (or what romantically/sexually inexperienced men are like for that matter) just by what you see online. Rare people are more common online. What you see online doesn't debunk statistical and empirical evidence. For example, in real life, death metal fans are rare to meet, but online, they're more common.  Misogynistic men aren't usually virgins. It just seems that way because social media and the news often emphasize the rare ones while ignoring the usual ones who are promiscuous, hypermasculine womanizers? Why? Because virgin men are an easy target for ridicule. Chads and sexually active men are not.  Myth 7: Blincels are a threat to society and are potential violent criminals.  No they are not, contrary to what IncelTear (aka IT) will tell you. In fact, most threads here are non-violent. IT just screenshot the most controversial or intense threads, which is cherrypicking.  Although a few massacres have been committed by self-identified incels, these are only a few massacres, comprising a minuscule percentage of massacres. [In fact](https://nationalpost.com/news/van-attack-killer-told-doctor-anxiety-over-job-not-incel-ideology-was-real-motivation-trial-hears), Alek Minassian (the man whose massacre gave the word 'incel' headlines on the news) later told an investigator that he is not an incel and only made that up for media attention, claiming anxiety over his job was his motive. [Additionally](https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/05/the-isla-vista-shooter-suffered-from-pathological-narcissism-not-autism/371768/), Elliot Rodger appeared to possibly have traits of narcissistic personality disorder. [In fact](https://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1177/0002764217730854), the media’s attention to incels and potential killers hearing about these killers in the media might encourage these mass shootings, given that this is a common motive among mass shooters. It is probable that many incel shooters had other traits that predisposed them to violence to begin with, and, without the incel community, would have still committed crime but with another motive. They do not appear to necessarily use or be influenced by forums.  [In fact, it appears that self-identified incels are more likely to hurt themselves than hurt others](https://doi.org/10.21428/88de04a1.b7b8b295). For example, there are more posts on the forums about suicide than homicide. Many use the word “rope” to describe suicide in general. Many believed the forum was helpful for them and they felt welcomed on the forum, expressing gratitude for it in their posts. Some even feared how heartbroken their families would be, which deterred them from resorting to suicide, and they were more likely to mention this as a deterrent than suicidal men in the general population. According to polls on the main forum Incels.is, most users reported seriously considering suicide. In fact, according to polls, alongside most users being suicidal, most users reported being frequently depressed or suffering extreme anxiety or stress. Although many users on the forum make misogynistic statements about women, some users are secretly not that misogynistic. [For](https://incels.is/threads/survey-results-oct-2019.147774/) [example](https://incels.is/threads/survey-results-august-2020.236459/), in polls, only about half of the users rated themselves as a 4 or 5 on a scale of 1 to 5 when asked how misogynistic or hateful toward women they were. A fifth rated themselves a 3, and about a quarter rated themselves a 1 or 2. In one poll created by a user instead of an administrator, about half of the incels said they do not hate women. This means they might pretend to hate women to blend in, resulting in a spiral of silence. In fact, the users were slightly more likely to be misanthropic (i.e.: hateful towards humans) and slightly more likely to be non-misogynists than non-misanthropes. This is obvious due to the fact that the users on there also denigrate other men as “chads” or “normies” or stereotype men who do not fit in with the forum as “cucks”, “betabuxxers” or “fakecels”. The forum also uses the phrase “clown world” to condemn society. Some incels tried talking to therapists, but it usually did not work, and some lacked access to mental health services. In fact, [many adult virgins in general](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21676968211064109) lack access to professionals, said they were afraid of talking to professionals because they worry professionals wouldn't understand their inexperience problems or would ridicule them, or even had negative experiences with professionals. This is why 'seek a therapist' is easier said than done. Many self-identified incels said they do not have any friends, which also prevents them from having confidants. While most report being suicidal, the vast majority said they do not plan on carrying out an act of violence due to involuntary celibacy. In fact, on a scale of 1 to 5 of how dangerous they perceive themselves to be due to being incel, most did not consider themselves dangerous and only a minuscule percentage considered themselves that dangerous. It is unknown if the low minority who said they will commit violence would actually commit violence and if it is going to be murder or rape or just merely a crime like physical assault.  Incels.is, the most popular self-identified incel forum, [tends to have much more self-loathing than loathing others](https://www.documentjournal.com/2021/12/inside-the-incelosphere-where-the-lonely-get-lonelier/). People on the forum tend to post more about self-loathing than loathing others. It is common to see people on the forum condone suicide more than violence against others. Although 38% of the forum said they entertain thoughts of violence against others, the vast majority do not plan to become violent. When asked if they would rape a woman if they could get away with it (a hypothetical scenario), 79.4% said no, and 76.8 to 82% did not admire killers like Elliot Rodger, Alek Minassian or Christopher Harper Mercer. Alexander Ash, the creator of the forum who eventually left, said that incels typically join the forum because they cannot find a place to talk about their issues given that most people cannot understand or empathize with their romantic or sexual inexperience. They typically are lonely and join the forum because they have nowhere else to go. After joining these forums, the forums influenced them, and many of the most extremist users mentioned becoming more extremist as they used the forum more. People on the forum do not just crave sex, but also love, affection and relationships. It is possible that if society did not stigmatize romantically or sexually inexperienced people, act like they do not exist in adulthood or lack empathy towards what they go through, these forums would never have flourished. In other words, society caused these forums to exist. Misogyny and sexual entitlement appears to be a symptom of the forum instead of a cause. Misogyny might be a secondary factor for these forums’ existence whereas stigmatization by society and mental health problems is a primary factor.  Given that women might also be subjected to intimate partner violence or even intimate partner rape, this means that men who harm women are rarely virgins or romantically inexperienced. Men who harm women often are romantically or sexually experienced. Due to how self-identified incel forums grow like what was mentioned earlier and due to statistics about what misogynistic men and men who attack women really are like, the self-identified incels should not be viewed through a criminal perspective but should be viewed through a stigmatization and mental health perspective. To prevent these forums from attracting members, society needs to change its attitudes towards romantically or sexually inexperienced people. It is important to reduce society’s tendency toward virgin shaming and society’s lack of empathy or understanding toward what involuntarily celibate people go through in order to reduce the number of people resorting to misogynistic, misanthropic incel forums. This could prevent people from resorting to these forums. Additionally, the subreddit r/IncelTears, a subreddit that takes screenshots of incel threads and mocks and insults them, has been shown to further alienate incel forum users or damage their mental health even more, sometimes to the point where they make self-identified incels feel suicidal. Subreddits like r/IncelTears could be interpreted as cyberbullying subreddits.  Incel violence is rare (the media just overemphasizes it), and most of the people on here eventually get permabanned or just simply leave the forum. They usually just go through a phase. Hardly any are a threat to others, and they need to be helped and have a confidant. This could've made us less likely to have resorted to these forums.  This appears to be one of the few forums where we can speak about our problems without gaslighting cunts who tell us 'relationships and sex are nothing important'. Even on r/ForeverAlone or r/virgin, there are visitors coming occasionally who do that shit to people on those subreddits. People on this forum needed to find a place of belongingness, and just got influenced by these forums, but where else can we go anyways?  I wish society was more understanding and helpful towards sexually/romantically inexperienced people. When sexually active people talk about their lack of satisfaction because their partner is bad at sex or they have erectile dysfunction or they aren't having sex frequently or orgasming enough we have ads, news articles, tiktok videos, etc. helping them out, but when an inexperienced person with romance/sex past their teens/early 20s talks about how lonely they are, people either trivialize their problems telling them this is nothing important in life and tell them how they can or cannot feel about what they're going through, or people just ridicule them for being inexperienced. Society is why these forums exist. Misogyny and sexual entitlement is only a secondary reason. It's not the main reason and the fact that misogynistic people or sexual entitlement exists out there in this world is a mere coincidence.   How do I know most people here joined for belongingness or were simply influenced by these forums?  In my [poll](https://incels.is/threads/why-did-you-join-this-forum.292496/) of 120 respondents (so far) asking them why they joined, 49.2% said they discovered the blackpill and read about it, 56.7% said that because society lacks empathy towards sexually/romantically inexperienced people and trivializes their problems, and 41.7% said it's a forum where they can reveal they're a virgin without being ridiculed. In another [poll](https://incels.is/threads/did-this-forum-or-reading-about-the-blackpill-change-the-way-you-think-about-women.370043/) of mine with 202 respondents so far, when asked if joining this forum or reading about the blackpill changed their opinion of women to negative, 44.1% said yes, 36.6% said they hated women before joining this forum or discovering the blackpill but that this forum increased their hatred, and 19.3% said they hated women before they joined these forums or discovered the blackpill, period. This means a majority (about 65.5%) of the ones who initially still hated them became more hateful. It could be they didn't think anything violent or intense about women or really anyone at all. And a few who said they still hated women before this forum said it's because before joining this forum they were on other similar forums. In another [poll](https://incels.is/threads/if-people-didnt-stigmatize-virgins-or-lack-empathy-toward-involuntary-celibates-and-helped-them-find-partners-would-you-have-still-joined-the-forum.370419/) of mine with 108 respondents so far, when asking users if they would've still joined the forum if society didn't stigmatize virgins or lack empathy towards lonely romantically/sexually inexperienced people, 44.4% said they probably or definitely would not have joined, and many of the ones who said they still would've joined perhaps would've sung a different tune if the hypothetical scenario happened.  TLDR: incels on here aren't a threat, many just joined a forum that influenced them, but if society wants to fix this problem, they should do something about virgin shaming and society's stigma against relationship virgins, too. They should stop telling romantically/sexually inexperienced people 'sex and relationships aren't important. there's more to life than that' when many of them experience it regularly and take it for granted. They should help inexperineced people learn how to find a partner rather than tell them how they can or cannot feel about it, which just invalidates how they feel and alienates them. Society should stop disacknowledging the existence of adult virgins while acknowledging the existence of 13 year olds who have sex or relationships or people who fuck 100 people, which is not as a common as adult virgins/relationship virgins. Society should realize that if misogyny or sexual entitlement didn't exist as much as it does, these forums would still attract members because many initially didn't hate anyone, and [misogyny (hate of women) isn't as widespread as people think](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343253834_The_Myth_of_Pervasive_Misogyny). In fact, ideas such as women should be mothers or shouldn't be breadwinners have more to do with benevolent sexism or gender roles/social norms than hatred of women. Most sexism on Earth is benevolent sexism, and misogyny isn't as widespread. If society wasn't like this towards inexperienced people, these forum users probably wouldn't have resorted to these forums to begin with, regardless of whether misogyny and sexual entitlement exists in society or not.  In fact, subreddits like IT telling people here they deserve to be miserable and kicking them while they're down just reinforces why they joined in the first place. People here needed confidants, not ridicule, and that could've deterred resorting to these forums. People on this forum need confidants in order to no longer need these forums.

Actually, [most](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/21676968211064109) [adult virgins often want relationships, love and intimacy too](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3813706?seq=8#metadata_info_tab_contents).

0	1660873556	CircumcisedClown	So I had to sit through another 4 hour lecture on how to not rape people from my job. We have these sexual assault powerpoints all the time, but it makes no difference. My coworkers, male or female, get raped all the time because most humans are dull, aggressive animals. My job says it has a zero tolerance for rape, but I have yet to see someone actually shuttled out for it. Not my problem, but I digress.  Anyways, I’m listening to this old woman talk about sex, her sex life, consent, the occasional dirty joke, and I’m trying to just focus on sitting there and getting paid.  She makes some pretty logical points: >Consent is required anytime you wish to cross the boundary of someone else’s body >You have no right to someone else’s body, even if they’re spouses/family >Even if it doesn’t make sense to you, the other person has every right to refuse because it’s their body >Our bodies are the only thing we ever truly own, so take care of them and others  Then she started talking about minors, and how her son, who was 16, would be approached by older woman because he looks like an adult. This was to lead up to a point about staying away from minors, but a lightbulb went off in my head.  I wonder if her son is circumcised? Who am I kidding, of course he is. He’s a young, white male in Midwestern America.  My point being that this woman has dedicated her life to preaching to others, at length, about respecting other people’s boundaries and keeping your hands to yourself, but she performed non-consensual, cosmetic penis surgery on her own child.  Circumcision is where morals, values, and logic go to die. It’s a blackhole in every American’s sense of reason. The one exception to everything normies supposedly stand for. If you complain about it, normies laugh at you, as if you don’t even have rights to your own penis. Humans are incapable of introspection.	https://incels.is/threads/circumcision-is-a-black-hole-of-logic.401080/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/venting_circumcision_is_a_black_hole_of_logic.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/venting_circumcision_is_a_black_hole_of_logic.tsv	1660873556	Venting Circumcision Is A Black Hole of Logic	18	467	0

14	1662068256	Coyote	What do you mean? It's disgusting to have sex with anyone under the age of 21 (in Bahrain).  If you go to California, USA it's suddenly not disgusting for some reason. I can't explain it, but when I'm in California, it just feels right to be attracted to 18 year old women. Anything below that though is absolutely vile. 17.9999 years old is not old enough to consent. That's rape.  Until I go to Colorado, where suddenly I am into 17 year old girls. But anything below that and I'm disgusted with the immaturity that young women show. Sex with 16.9999 year olds is sexual assault. Having sex with 16.9999 year olds makes you a pedophile and a rapist, you deserve to go to prison.  Until I go to Washington D.C., where suddenly I find 16 year old girls attractive. Anything below that though and I'm absolutely disgusted. How could anyone think sex between a 15.9999 year old and a fully grown adult man is okay? That's so disgusting!! Rape!  Until I go to Aruba, where suddenly I'm into 15 year old women. But anything below that is 100% rape.    ALL PARENTS are good. Listen to your parents everybody.

Many also argue it's easier for women to get sex but harder for them to get relationships because men are too interested in sex and women are too interested in relationships.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]These theories are all false. There's also this theory that evolution is why women are choosier. Nope. This is also a myth for the reason why.[/UWSL] [UWSL]Let's address each argument:[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Pregnancy[/UWSL]  [UWSL]First of all, you can be in a relationship and still have an unwanted pregnancy. It's not like dating someone or hooking up deters condom use, birth control, etc. This is ridiculous. In fact, [/UWSL][[UWSL]statistics[/UWSL]](https://www.guttmacher.org/fact-sheet/unintended-pregnancy-united-states#)[UWSL] show that cohabiting women have a much higher unwanted pregnancy rate (141 per 1,000) compared to unmarried, noncohabiting women (36 to 54 per 1,000) and married women (29 per 1,000). This means women often get unwanted pregnancies from people they are already in a relationship with.[/UWSL] [UWSL]According to [/UWSL][UWSL]Psychology Today[/UWSL][UWSL] (link below),[/UWSL] [UWSL]Safety[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Let's take a look at how often women feel unsafe doing certain things, because feminists overstate it a bit.[/UWSL] [UWSL]According to a [/UWSL][[UWSL]YouGov poll[/UWSL]](https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2019/03/28/women-safety-sexual-assault-awareness)[UWSL], when it comes to going on a first date, only 21% of women often or always feel unsafe (10% vs 11%, respectively). 31% sometimes felt unsafe, and 35% rarely or never felt unsafe (25% vs 10%, respectively). This means 79% felt safe at least sometimes if not often. Only 19% always or often felt unsafe when at a bar alone (e.g.: waiting for a friend), whereas 51% felt often or always safe (29% vs 22%, respectively) and 27% felt sometimes safe. When it came to going to a stranger's house, it was common (43%) for women to feel unsafe, but not necessarily [/UWSL][UWSL]always[/UWSL][UWSL] (which shouldn't explain why they don't hook up as much or don't have an interest in dating a man as much). 23% always felt unsafe and 20% often did. 30% sometimes felt unsafe going to a stranger's house, compared to 22% rarely or never feeling unsafe. If a woman agrees to go to a man's place, she probably feels more trusting towards him in particular.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Crime statistics[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Now lets look at crime. If women are choosy about who they date because of safety, then that doesn't make sense, because most men they ghost or reject aren't like that and most of the time that has nothing to do why she doesn't reciprocate interest. It's because she wasn't interested in him or didn't seem him as the right one. There can be exceptions to this rule here and there but that's typically the reason. In fact, intimate partner violence is actually a gender-symmetrical crime. Most intimate partner violence is actually [/UWSL][UWSL]mutual[/UWSL][UWSL]. [/UWSL][[UWSL]Both are the aggressors, and in non-reciprocal cases, women are the aggressors up to 70% of the time[/UWSL]](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-psychiatrist/article/domestic-violence-is-most-commonly-reciprocal/C5432B0C6F8F61B49A4E2B60B931FA07)[UWSL]. In fact, mutual violence was the most likely to result in an injury. Male victims are far less likely than female victims to report the crime or even tell anyone about it, so that's why all the survivors we hear about the female victims of male perpetrators. [/UWSL][[UWSL]Women are just as likely, if not more likely, than men to commit intimate partner violence[/UWSL]](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Murray-Straus/publication/233717660_Thirty_Years_of_Denying_the_Evidence_on_Gender_Symmetry_in_Partner_Violence_Implications_for_Prevention_and_Treatment/links/54ef34ea0cf25f74d721bf2c/Thirty-Years-of-Denying-the-Evidence-on-Gender-Symmetry-in-Partner-Violence-Implications-for-Prevention-and-Treatment.pdf)[UWSL], and it's not usually in self-defense.[/UWSL] [UWSL]As for rape or sexual assault, this is also a gender symmetrical crime. Feminists often speak about how women don't report rapes, but there's still some who do even if most don't. A minuscule percentage of male rape victims report in comparison. In fact, the vast majority of rapes reported to the police were male-perpetrator-female-victim because male victims are way less likely to report it or even tell anyone about it. That's why we only hear about men raping women. Men often get forced to penetrate, but apparently that's not labeled rape because they aren't being penetrated (it's still rape). [/UWSL][[UWSL]Just as many men are forced to penetrate each year as women are raped[/UWSL]](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4062022/)[UWSL], and the perpetrators are women the vast majority of the time. [/UWSL][[UWSL]Lifetime prevalence[/UWSL]](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf)[UWSL] of being made to penetrate for men vs lifetime prevalence being raped for women show a gap (women were way more likely to be raped in their lifetime compared to men made to penetrate in their lifetime), but this is because [/UWSL][[UWSL]rape rates against women have declined[/UWSL]](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf)[UWSL] but made to penetrate rates against men have skyrocketed. That's why there's a gap in lifetime prevalence but not past-year prevalence. For example:[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Millennial men were less likely than baby boomer and generation X men to have committed sexual violence but millennial women were more likely than baby boomer/generation X women to have done so. Nonetheless, it was not relatively unusual for baby boomer/generation X women to have committed sexual violence against men. Millennial women were more likely to rape through physical force than millennial men, but almost as likely to have raped someone than millennial men through intoxication. When it came to baby boomers/Generation X, women were as likely as men to rape through physical force, but men were more likely to rape through intoxication, but there also women who did so, too. Through all three generations, men were more likely to engage in sexual coercion (which is different from rape), but the gap wasn't super big with millennials, but baby boomer/generation X women sometimes still did it. Although baby boomer/generation X men were more likely to commit statutory rape with someone under 16, millennial women were more likely than millennial men to have done so. When it came to sex while being an authority for the victim such as a boss, teacher, babysitter, etc., there was no perpetrator gender gap among baby boomers/generation X but millennial women were more likely to have taken advantage of a student, employee, babysat person, etc. than men.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]According to CDC, women were more likely than men to experience sexual coercion in both lifetime and past year prevalence, but men were a very significant minority of sexual coercion victims, with the vast majority reporting a female perpetrator. Nonetheless, past-year prevalence for being made to penetrate was equal to past-year prevalence for women being raped, despite a gap existing for lifetime prevalence. This is in line with evidence showing that younger generations of women being more likely to commit rape than older generations but older generations of men being more likely to rape than younger generations of men. Perpetration rates of rape were equal for millennial men and women but a gap existed for baby boom/generation X men and women. But sexual coercion perpetration rates for both generations showing somewhat of a gap match how more women are victims of sexual coercion than men in the lifetime and past year.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Men who are made to penetrate are usually young men often ages 18 to 24, and if forced to penetrate rates against men have skyrocketed (same with women committing sexual violence in general against men), then this means older generations of men are less likely to have experienced in the past year and in their lifetime back when they were young adults themselves. This explains why lifetime gap but lack of past-year prevalence gap in how often men are made to penetrate vs women being raped. [/UWSL][[UWSL]In fact, even college women[/UWSL]](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/ccsvsftr.pdf)[UWSL] just as likely if not slightly more likely than college men to commit rape, and are about as likely as college men to commit other forms of sexual assault and sexual assault in general. The data showed a gap in victimization but it could be because it only asked about being penetrated instead of made to penetrate, too.[/UWSL] [UWSL]In fact, according to the CDC, men are just as likely if not more likely to experience unwanted sexual contact in the past year, and half the time they report a female perpetrator. There's a gap in lifetime prevalence, but men who experienced it more than a year ago might be less likely than women who experienced it to remember it because if you teach people only women get sexually assaulted, then men might be less likely to remember being sexually assaulted unless it's particularly traumatic like rape/sexual coercion instead of being groped in the butt or something, so when you teach people something, anything they see that defies what they've been taught won't be remembered due to a subsconscious confirmation bias, but anything they see that reinforces what they were taught will be recalled. That's why men are presumably less likely to remember being groped more than a year ago compared to women.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Also, most murder victims are men, and men are more likely to be crime victims, and the gap according to NCVS would be probably bigger if we included forced to penetrate questions in the crime victimization survey. [/UWSL][UWSL][If you look up statistics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv10.pdf)[/UWSL][UWSL], men are [/UWSL][UWSL][most robbery victims](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rv.pdf)[/UWSL][UWSL], most aggravated assault victims, [/UWSL][UWSL][more likely to be carjacked](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/c02.pdf)[/UWSL][UWSL] or victims of motor vehicle theft, more likely to be property crime victims, and more likely to be attacked by a stranger.

Additionally, men might be more killed by their girlfriends than people think. A lot of evidence shows that women might get away with it more because many might hire hitmen or use poisoning. Murderers who poison are far more likely to be a woman, and it could be that male poisoners might get caught more, making it seem like most poisoners are still men because cops don't suspect a woman. They'll just assume the victim died of poison accident. [/UWSL][UWSL][For example](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Legalizing_Misandry/cqKxhhu55SMC?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=women+hire+hitmen+to+kill+statistics&pg=PA238&printsec=frontcover)[/UWSL][UWSL], in multiple offender killings there are 4x as many husbands killed as wives. This means of all married people killed by a group, there's way more married men than married women killed. This means she could've hired hitmen and the hitmen never snitched, and cops won't suspect her because she's a woman, and hitmen hired by women are possibly less likely to snitch on her than hitmen hired by men, inflating statistics showing gender in contract killings. Also, [/UWSL][UWSL][contrary to popular belief](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1525/ctx.2006.5.2.21)[/UWSL][UWSL], women who kill husbands usually don't do it in self-defense, and we don't know if women who say they did were truthful or lying to get sympathy (some evidence shows that sex offenders might lie about being molested as a kid to get sympathy from the public, although some still were molested as a kid). Women only kill in almost 10% of murders they commit, but women who kill husbands were no more likely to do so than women who kill in other circumstances. They were also just as likely as other female murderers to have criminal records. [/UWSL][UWSL][In fact](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/wo.pdf)[/UWSL][UWSL], most female criminals commit crimes against women and most male criminals commit crimes against men.

Men are more likely to beat up other men than beat their girlfriends but women are more likely to beat up their boyfriends than beat up other women.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]In conclusion and additionally, it doesn't seem like safety is why women might be more choosier than men with both short-term and long-term relationship nor is it why women might ghost more, flake more, have less interest in casual sex, etc. This will be explained below.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Why women are more selective than men or have less interest in hooking up or dating a guy[/UWSL]  [UWSL]The real reason isn't because of safety. According to a [/UWSL][[UWSL]research paper[/UWSL]](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.387.8348&rep=rep1&type=pdf)[UWSL] about gender differences in short-term mating, they wrote:[/UWSL]  [UWSL]It appears if a woman even tried to give a guy a chance to begin with, she usually considered him safe. In fact, according to [/UWSL][[UWSL]Psychology Today[/UWSL]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sexual-personalities/201706/what-type-person-would-agree-have-sex-stranger)[UWSL]:[/UWSL] [UWSL]The reason why women are choosier, flake more, ghost more, etc. is because men pursue, women get pursued. According to the same paper:[/UWSL] [UWSL]In fact, even lesbians are no more interested in casual sex than women, yet lesbians are around other women. In fact, gay men were just as into casual sex as straight men. Men are more into casual sex than women, regardless of sexual orientation. Gay men have more casual sex than straight men, but it's because they are being with OTHER MEN, whereas men have to go for women if they're straight. So safety isn't why women get less into casual sex:[/UWSL] [UWSL]Psychology Today also wrote:[/UWSL]   [UWSL]In fact, even with men they know, women aren't as interested. According to [/UWSL][[UWSL]Scientific American[/UWSL]](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/men-and-women-cant-be-just-friends/)[UWSL], in opposite-sex friendships, men are far more likely than women to be attracted to their opposite-sex friend, and men are more likely to overestimate their friend's interest in them whereas women are more likely to underestimate their friend's interest in them.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Men often get ghosted or flaked on or rejected even if they didn't do anything remotely suspicious. Men pursue women, so a man typically desires any woman he pursues, but the women who get pursued don't necessarily recriprocate interest. As a result, men will fall in love quicker, find first dates more attractive, etc. Men get more attached, but being attached or falling in love quicker doesn't mean he will be clingy or text too much, so even that isn't necessarily the reason why women ghost, flake or reject more frequently nor does it explain why women are choosier. A man doesn't have to signal how much he fell in love unless he acts too overt about it.[/UWSL] [UWSL]Also, the reason isn't because men just want sex while women just want relationships. Men fall in love quicker, and in a [/UWSL][[UWSL]study[/UWSL]](https://sci-hub.se/https://doi.org/10.1080/15299716.2018.1563935)[UWSL] measuring how willing people (straight men, straight women, and gay men but they did not include lesbians) are to date bisexuals, they found that men were more likely than women to find someone of the opposite gender both romantically and sexually attractive, and were more willing to date them or have sex with him, regardless of the target or participant's sexual orientation. Even gay men found a man more romantically/sexually attractive and were more willing to have sex with the man or date him compared to how women perceive the man, regardless of the target's sexual orientation. The study digged into people's subconscious because many people might refuse to admit they won't date bisexuals due to potential biphobia accusations, but straight women were less interested in dating a bisexual compared to straight men and gay men and straight women perceived bisexual men as less masculine (table below and read caption please).

This is why other guys will be more likely to tell you 'you look good'. This was found to be true regardless of age of the target.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]TLDR  So why are women more selective than men? [/UWSL][[UWSL]Because men pursue women[/UWSL]](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/the-psychology-relationships/202011/what-happens-when-men-and-women-reverse-dating-roles)[UWSL]. When women get pursued, they have so many options to choose from, it makes them choosy. Men have to pursue, and not every woman they pursue will like them back, so men lower their standards to increase their odds. In a speed dating study where they made women pursue men, women were less choosy and men were more choosy. This is called the Sadies Hawkins effect. Women's choosiness isn't because of evolution. It's because men pursue, women get pursued. When you have many options to choose from, you get more choosy. When you have to pursue and you don't know who will like you back, you're less choosy.[/UWSL]"	https://incels.is/threads/the-reason-women-are-more-selective-than-men-is-not-because-of-pregnancy-worries-safety-etc-the-real-reason-is-because-men-pursue-women.392419/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_the_reason_women_are_more_selective_than_men_is_not_because_of_pregnancy_worries_safety_et.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_the_reason_women_are_more_selective_than_men_is_not_because_of_pregnancy_worries_safety_et.tsv	1658372609	Blackpill The reason women are more selective than men is NOT because of pregnancy worries, safety, etc. The real reason is because men pursue women.	36	2K	0
39	1661891324	IncelWithHate	 Women view rape completely differently - either as a turn on, another excuse to victim monger, sexually humblebrag or some combination of that.   I swear you just ramble off random shit and somehow are under the delusion you're being deep.    Most thieves are in prison or end up dead. You're actually arguing outliers. Thus the more rational decision is to choose the overwhelmingly safer option. Rape itself isn't rational by your own criteria, because the risk/reward ratio is very high in the developed world. Hilariously, you bring up this point and then proceed to dismiss it out of hand:    This is actually irrelevant to my stance on rape. That said...   You're still an idiot.   I'm not some warrior in a tribe thousands of years ago, I exist in a 'modern day context' here and now. Thus, its perfectly rational to act in accordance to the paradigm I find myself in.   You might as well say I'm similarly irrational for not going outside in bear cloth with a spear. We are homo sapiens living in a interdependent, technologically developed civilization. Not homo erectus wandering the savannah.   Rape possesses no benefits for me individually (I gain no sexual gratification from it), or through the lens of a modern context. It doesn't appeal to me at all personally since I desire lust in a partner nor am I dominant. Its not worth it from a sexual reproduction standpoint because a) I don't want offspring, b) offspring are net losses in a post agricultural society (ie. children are massive consumers) and c) I risk not only persecution and jail time, but potential murder by white knights.   There is no upside, even from a short term benefit analysis.     The only one projecting is you. What my ancestors did is irrelevant. And the only one who determines my pride and self-respect is me. Not some hole.   BTW, since you define rape as massively skewed in favor of benefit why aren't you eagerly engaging in sexual assault? According to you, rape should be the infinitely more rational option to even escortcelling (which you advocate) because then you wouldn't have to part with your hard earned resources.   So why are you still paying whores instead of forcing them?    I've just proven how there is absolutely no benefit to me raping, and multiple downsides. Destroying your weak excuses for arguments should be considered child abuse on this forum.	https://incels.is/threads/if-rape-was-legal-would-you-rather-rape-or-have-normal-sex.404701/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/experiment_if_rape_was_legal_would_you_rather_rape_or_have_normal_sex.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/experiment_if_rape_was_legal_would_you_rather_rape_or_have_normal_sex.tsv	1661858747	Experiment If rape was legal would you rather rape or have normal sex?	50	884	39

They can be subjected to sexual trafficking, forced labor or being sent off as a soldier (a loophole due to the country's absence of conscription). For example, boys often age 13 and under often were sexually trafficked into Bacha Bazi or 'boy play', which was a custom where young boys were forced into entertainment where they danced or sang sexually as male entertainers for adult men and were raped repeatedly by their captors and his friends. At least 50 percent of sexual exploitation in Afghanistan was bacha bazi, and it often crossed lines into forced labor. Boys age 13 and under were most likely to be sexually exploited, and because Afghan girls were banned from sexual work and entertainment because they were seen as child-bearers and homemakers, [/UWSL][Afghan boys were picked as a substitute for sexual gratification](https://76crimes.com/2021/10/21/sex-trafficking-of-boys-contributed-to-taliban-victory-in-afghanistan/)[UWSL], being seen as a substitute for women. As a result, the people raping them saw them as a fake woman and didn't consider themselves gay for raping them. Taliban opposed Bacha Bazi but American-backed Afghan leaders practiced it and American forces ignored it. This led to support towards Taliban from families of victims and others opposed to the practice. The boys were made to dress in feminine attire and were released as soon as they grew beards. Many powerful Afghan men supported the practice because they believed women are for children and boys are for sexual gratification.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Boys are more likely to be trafficked in Afghanistan than girls, as mentioned above, and often forced into forced labor or being a soldier, with young men ages 14-18 often being forced as soldiers or forced labor. Many soldiers were forced to become suicide bombers and young men put in forced labor worked in mines, worked in the streets or assistant truck driving.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Crime victimization and abuse[/UWSL]  [Physical abuse and corporal punishment is common for Afghan kids](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0220614&type=printable)[UWSL]. Except for baseline, boys were more likely than girls to experience physical punishment at home. Boys were also more likely than girls to experience peer violence victimization. Boys also scored higher than girls on depression, but often admittedly scored slightly higher on hope. Schools and teachers also inflicted corporal punishment and violence, particularly on boys. 100% of boy schools and only 20% of girl schools involved physical punishment from teachers. The same study found high rates of sexual abuse, including rape, of boys at schools, often by male teachers and older boys.[/UWSL] [UWSL]When it comes to physical abuse, mothers often can be aggressors. In a [/UWSL][study](https://www.whatworks.co.za/documents/publications/424-ndungu-et-al-gibbs-2021-afghan-child-punishment-sem-15122021/file)[UWSL], 71.8% of married women admitted to physically abusing their children, and a little less than half said their partner also did so, which means many times their partner, presumably a husband, did [/UWSL][UWSL]not[/UWSL][UWSL] do so. [/UWSL][In a study of physical abuse of children in Afghanistan](https://areu.org.af/wp-content/areu_publications/2016/01/804E-Love-Fear-and-Discipline-IP-print.pdf.pdf)[UWSL], men were more likely to believe boys got more physically disciplined, possibly due to probably experiencing it themselves or due to boys being perceived as potentially troublemakers. Women believed girls were beaten more, and women reported higher levels of violence directed towards girls because men might be unaware of violence mothers inflict on girls in the house.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Murder/homicide[/UWSL]  [UWSL]In Afghanistan, [/UWSL][87% of homicide victims are men](https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/data/GSH2013_Sex_data.xlsx)[UWSL]. [/UWSL][In fact](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2021/9/10/it-is-time-we-remember-afghan-men-are-also-victims-of-this-war)[UWSL], Afghan men and boys were killed all the time and American media only focused on the women and children, portraying Afghan men as sexist oppressors, but these men are usually victims instead. Due to media portraying Afghan men as evil misogynistic terrorists, the American military killed many male Afghan civilians and assumed they were terrorists. The media used feminist language (even the right-wing media did this) to portray women there as damsels in distress in need to help but not due to care for the women there, but to influence Americans into supporting the war against Afghanistan. America's war created so many political and economic issues, it made Afghanistan even more dangerous and violent for women and even for men. In fact, the US military only helped solely women who claimed to be harmed by Taliban, so many women lied and said the Taliban hurt them to get US aid from the US military. Most American soldiers, just like their political leaders or generals, did not distinguish between Afghan male civilians and Taliban fighters, and thus killed many male civilians. They often were unlawfully imprisoned, tortured and killed by the US military despite being civilians. Often mistaken as security threats instead of civilians, these men were killed either by the US military or by Taliban. According to the [/UWSL][UWSL]Bureau of Investigative Journalism[/UWSL][UWSL], between January 2004 and February 2020, the US conducted at least 13,072 drone attacks in Afghanistan, killing 4126 to 10,076 people. 300 to 909 of those killed are believed to have been civilians. It's impossible to know how many were really civilians, because the US did everything to obscure this number. As the New York Times [/UWSL][explained](https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/29/world/obamas-leadership-in-war-on-al-qaeda.html)[UWSL] in 2012, for example, the Obama administration counted “all military-age males [killed] in a strike zone as combatants … unless there is explicit intelligence posthumously proving them innocent.” “Counterterrorism officials,” the Times article went on to say, “insist this approach is one of simple logic: people in an area of known terrorist activity, or found with a top Qaeda operative, are probably up to no good.” Thus, many Afghan men who were civilians were killed by being guilty by association. They lived in Afghanistan in areas the US attacked, being labeled as automatically terrorists by default.[/UWSL]  [In fact](https://news.un.org/en/story/2021/07/1096382)[UWSL], the media emphasizes women and children in Afghanistan who are wounded or killed, when adult men are the most likely to have been killed. In Afghanistan, of all civilian casualties, 32% were women and 14% were children. This means 54% were men. Men were the most likely to be casualties, more so than women and more so than children. Not to mention some these children are presumably boys. The media emphasizes exclusively the women and children who are killed.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Taliban's treatment of boys[/UWSL]  [Taliban have turned so many young boys into soldiers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/09/20/our-opportunity-end-talibans-use-child-soldiers)[UWSL]. Boys as young as 6 are indoctrinated, and by age 13, learned how to use firearms. By their teenage years they were required to fight. The US-backed Afghan government and pro-government forces also recruited and used young boys. Taliban also used these boys to carry out suicides and other violent attacks, recruiting them through deception, promises of money or other incentives, or even threats. Taliban and other armed forces used young boys many times to carry out suicide bombings because they thought they could manipulate them more easily and might be less suspicious than adults. The US-backed former Afghan government and other pro-government forces also recruited young boys as recruitment and using them to fight. [/UWSL][Taliban used many young boys even as young as age 7 as suicide bombers](https://www.hrw.org/news/2011/08/31/afghanistan-taliban-should-stop-using-children-suicide-bombers)[UWSL], telling them lies like they would survive the bombing themselves if they were an amulet with Quran verses on it. Boys as young as 11 were also recruited by Taliban to carry out activities like smuggling weapons across the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, planting explosive devices, and armed combat. There were even 5 year olds used to plant bombs in south Afghanistan.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Another thing people must realize about Afghanistan is that women didn't lack rights in Afghanistan before Taliban took over. Look up pre-Taliban Afghanistan and women didn't need to wear veils and they were much more liberated and dressed in Western clothes and often had prestigious jobs. It was like America. Honestly if the CIA didn't give weapons to Islamic fundamentalist warriors in Afghanistan during the Afghan-Soviet War in the 80s, Taliban would've never taken over. That's how osama bin laden got his weapons. The CIA gave the mujahideen guerillas weapons which helped them fight off Soviets and they saved Afghanistan but these guerillas turned Afghanistan into another war zone. Then, the Taliban told Afghans that they would stop the war zones and offered an alternative, which many Afghans thought would liberate and save Afghanistan. They then recruited many people deceptively to increase the number of Taliban members, and this helped Taliban take over. A year after taking over, Taliban then began to become oppressive, which citizens didn't expect. If it wasn't for the CIA, the mujahideen wouldn't have taken over and thus Taliban wouldn't have been able to offer an alternative to citizens and take over. The CIA indirectly created Taliban. The CIA also are why Osama bin Laden managed to get weapons.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Iran[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Iran didn't make women dress a certain way or do anything particularly oppressive until 1979 when the Islamic Revolution happened. Before that, Iran was a secular monarchy and it wasn't different from the Western world. Women back then had more rights than women today in Iran. If it wasn't for the 1953 CIA assassination of their prime minister, King Shah wouldn't have had such a firm rule over Iran, which eventually led to Iranians having a fit about him and overthrowing him, creating modern Iran. The CIA's actions eventually led to modern Iran happening. But men in Iran have it just as bad as women in Iran. [/UWSL][This article](https://avoiceformen.com/featured/the-myth-of-patriarchal-oppression-in-iran/)[UWSL] should give a lot of information so read this article too. Boys in Iran are disproportionately raped or homeless, men are drafted, 81.9% of murder victims are men (see citation above for Afghan murder victims too which is where I got this from), and men are economically oppressed too. The media only shows what women go through. There's much more details about men's oppression in Iran. They aren't a patriarchy. They oppress everyone, just like America.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Syria and Iraq (ISIS)[/UWSL]  [UWSL]The media always talks about how ISIS oppress women, but they hurt men all the time. If you look at Syria, so many men are killed, including by ISIS.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Murder[/UWSL]  [Since March 2011, when the Syrian civil war began all the way up to now, 228,647 Syrian civilians have been killed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Syrian_civil_war#Civilian_deaths)[UWSL]. 79.4% of them were men (181,540 men), 6.96% were women (15,925 women), and 13% were children (29,741 children). Many of these children probably are boys. This means women were the least likely to be killed and usually men are killed. In fact, of all the 5,043 civilians ISIS killed, 68.65% were men, 11.64% were women, and 19% were children. Of the 200,367 civilians killed by Syrian government forces, 82.24% were men, 11.45% were children, and 5.96% were women. This means it's typically men being killed there. [/UWSL][Within their first year following the 2014 declaration of Caliphate](https://www.ibtimes.co.in/isis-has-beheaded-stoned-shot-1362-civilians-including-9-children-report-630716)[UWSL], ISIS had already killed 1,362 civilians, including 9 children and 19 women. This means 97.94% were men.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]Sexual assault[/UWSL]  [Many times the media shows women being made as sexual slaves by ISIS.

They often were held as prisoners and raped, gang raped, or sexually tortured with these men ranging from age 10 to age 80. They also might get jobs due to poverty while being sexually blackmailed or forced to do sexual favors in countries of asylum to be paid money. In asylum countries, boys might be molested by older youth and others. [/UWSL][This sexual abuse of men and boys is done by ISIS, other non-state armed groups, or even the Syrian government](https://www.hrw.org/report/2020/07/29/they-treated-us-monstrous-ways/sexual-violence-against-men-boys-and-transgender)[UWSL].

Armed groups even conducted raids on homes and raped both men and women. When fleeing, boys were promised food or money by older boys but were instead molested.

[/UWSL][When it comes to trafficking victims](https://www.state.gov/reports/2020-trafficking-in-persons-report/saudi-arabia/)[UWSL], they only give shelter to female domestic workers and nobody else.

Saudi Arabia is more happy than most countries. People there might think people in the Western world treat women poorly, and that not allowing women to do certain things is protecting them. It's called benevolent sexism rather than misogyny (or hostile sexism). The way America views Saudi Arabia is how they view America, but the people there don't necessarily agree with the government laws. [/UWSL][In Saudi Arabia, virtually everyone who is executed is male](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-60722057)[UWSL], and there's many kinds of capital crimes there, and two-thirds of homicide victims are men (citation above).

Women doing this to men wasn't even banned. So much for patriarchy. [/UWSL][In fact, in 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20131109094735/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/02/saudi-protest-driving-ban-not-popular)[UWSL], most Saudi Arabian women opposed the right to drive and they believed it would lead to sexual harassment, men betraying them, and other problems. They believed it was horrible America would allow women to drive and thought it led to women being harmed or unsafe from predators, and believed this was an imitation of America. They instead believe America allowing women to drive is oppression. They believing being prohibited from driving was a privilege. In fact, this is similar to how long ago, many women often didn't want the right to vote because they believe suffrage was harmful to women by allowing them into the dangerous world of politics and considered the lack of right to vote a privilege or luckiness. [/UWSL][In fact](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_suffrage#Dates_by_country)[UWSL], Afghanistan didn't allow anyone to vote until 2004 where everyone including women could vote.

There are more female victims of domestic violence than male victims in Morocco (35% vs 29%) Egypt (43% vs 26%) and Lebanon (56 vs 18%).

Although 53.4% said sometimes there are times where a woman deserves to be beaten, this doesn't mean they think this is always or frequently true and they might make special circumstances. They also could be thinking this only about wives instead of other women. [/UWSL][Many wife beaters frowned upon hitting a woman but believe their wife was an exception by simply being a wife](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0265407504045887?fbclid=IwAR0wZzdQoZkaZ3DWA39S5xWq39MNJsgxlvpS7e_rSfyZSwgSiscVuCNrOzc&casa_token=W4iFVvDtsJAAAAAA%3ARvP83B8Oa11VGuVa8ZVvhweLAMhLXI9703RbxvjQNbYNt2t-bYagPAHL8DlpMmNtn28DVAWfbCCUjg&journalCode=spra)[UWSL]. These Egyptian men still had conservative attitudes about men, most believed men and women both should not have friends of opposite gender, and most of them (80%) believed that boys are responsibile for the behavior of their sisters, even if they're younger than their sister. This means they believe the boy should be held responsible for something the sister did. Many views in the data do show you that Egyptian men have conservative attitudes towards women, but people who have conservative attitudes about what women should do or their jobs don't feel this way due to hatred of women, but due to social norms/gender roles which they still believe about men, too. Although only 55% of Egyptian men were willing to work with a female boss, 74% support equal salaries for men and women in the same position, and 86% were willing to work with female colleagues at the same level. 77% believed women with the same qualifications can do as good a job as men. 71.7% supported women as members of parliaments/assemblies, 58.9% supported women as government ministers, 93.4% supported women's suffrage, and 71.1% supported women as NGOs. Admittedly only 45% believed in laws banning domestic violence including marital rape, but that's because there's ones who thought sometimes women deserved to be beaten but it's unknown if they think it's ok under all circumstances. It's unknown however if they approve of marital rape PER SE. 58% think more should be done to achieve gender equality but 70% believe it exists already. 52% believe equality is not part of Egyptian culture. 94% believe men who fail to pay maintenence should be penalized. Women were far more likely to spank (79% of women and 41% of men) or hit their children (44% of women and 11% of men). Some of the men admitted to having slapped or pushed their wife before and some women experienced it but most did not experience in the past year. Relatively low percentages outright beat them, and even lower percentages did so in the past year. Hardly any threatened them with a weapon. 64% of Egyptian men and 60% of Egyptian women believed woman should marry her rapist, but 72% of men and 67% of women disagreed with the idea that rapists should not be prosecuted if he rapes a woman then marries her. Only just 16% of men believed a woman is obliged to have sex whenever the husband wants if he provides financially, compared to 33% of women thinking this. Nonetheless, 80% of men and 73% of women believe a woman should be able to refuse to have sex with her husband when she doesn't want to. Only a third of men and women believed men who commit honor killings should not be punished, so many think they should be punished, but 62% of men and 49% of women believe the woman usually deserved it.

Men and women are both oppressed there. The media just focuses on when women are but ignores men's problems there. Religion can be seen as sexist towards both men and women. But if people want gender equality they can't act like men were never privileged throughout history but then make a special exception for Muslim countries due to an anti-Islam bias. In fact, [/UWSL][the roots of sexism toward women in the Arab World go back to Ottoman empire problems, which is caused by western europe](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/04/the-real-roots-of-sexism-in-the-middle-east-its-not-islam-race-or-hate/256362/). It wasn't caused by Islam. Islam didn't cause sexism toward women in these countries. These countries weren't even always like this and pre-Islamic Arabia was actually WORSE for women until Muhammad came. It wasn't until the past couple centuries (and couple decades in some countries when it all changed) Dress codes in these countries used to be more diverse and vary until recent times[UWSL]. If people want gender equality they cannot act like feminists when it comes to Muslim nations. I've seen even MRA's act like feminists when it comes to muslim countries.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]No, the Quran doesn't say you can beat your wife. It says if she persistently behaves badly you can lightly spank her like what people do to children but it does NOT say you can beat her black and blue. If you do, you are punished in Islam and if you fatally beat her, you're executed. No, Saudi Arabia doesn't represent Islam. They're Wahhabis, which didn't exist until the 1700s or something. There's a dress code in Islam too, and men have to wear certain clothes covering their body and the Prophet even told men not to ogle women no matter what she dresses like and taught men self-control. That's another definition of hijab. Hijab also is a spiritual thing instead of just some headscarf for women. Men's hijabs exist too, it's the long clothes covering the legs and arms and shoulders and their self-control to avoid ogling women when it comes to what a man's hijab is. No, raping a woman isn't allowed in Islam. In fact, circumstantial evidence is allowed for proving rape in Islam and Muhammad did not punish victims and executed rapists. You don't near 4 witnesses for rape, you need 4 witnesses for ADULTERY. Stop believing what the media says about Islam, and most Middle Eastern governments don't represent true Islam.[/UWSL]  [UWSL]@Robtical pin?[/UWSL]	https://incels.is/threads/the-myth-of-male-privilege-in-muslim-countries.382143/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_the_myth_of_male_privilege_in_muslim_countries.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_the_myth_of_male_privilege_in_muslim_countries.tsv	1654974672	Discussion The myth of male privilege in muslim countries	95	9K	0

Lifeguards called police after receiving numerous reports that a group of men were 'sexually assaulting and harassing women' between 1pm and 5.30pm on Tuesday - the hottest day ever recorded in the UK.

0	1655769061	Incel_Because_Short	This is a story I never told on here but I feel like it needs to be shared to give hope to some of your incels that sometimes you can get ahead in life through your abilities and actions. It's a long story, but bear with me because it comes with an important lesson for you guys on how to actually beat normies, and how to protect yourself in the workplace.  This is in the military. Now, I was in a platoon with a section of 15 people, 10 guys and 5 girls. One of the guys there was a 48 year old Pakistani guy who was in to have some income for his family. Naturally, I made friends with him, despite me being 24 years old at the time, because I was an Arab and we were in a platoon full of whites.  I don't want to go into detail about what happened, but three of the girls were Stacy-like women who formed a clique and decided that they didn't like the Paki because he was 'creepy'. They tried to talk with him through me because supposedly I'm more 'westernized' (whatever the fuck that means, his English was fine). They wanted to frame him for harassment. What I did was make them believe I was on their side, and told them to all write the exact same memo about the guy, and that I would do the same.  I ended up writing a memo describing the opposite, that he was being ganged on. Our section had to sit with the division Chief, and they explicitly told the women to NEVER bother the Pakistani guy again. The girls obviously had a grudge on me and the Pakistani, but they couldn't do shit to us now as they have been exposed to be liars.  One of the Stacies was a 30 year old woman who would actually be posted to the same place as me once we graduated. She is quite good looking in all respects and definitely uses her charisma and physical appearance to her advantage. She was well connected there so she initially used her connections to give me absolute hell in my next posting. While awaiting training, she told the platoon IC that I was a bad person and I should get the worst taskings (cleaning people's laundry, moving furniture, etc), and I did that for a while. Even the division commander treated me with contempt on account of the Stacy saying that I was a bad worker, a bad person, etc.  Now, the way the training division was run was incredibly inefficient; it was basically a series of excel sheets updated by one or two people spanning many different offices. I have a computer programming background and a knowledge in database creation. A friend of mine, who I was talking to about this, was working in scheduling at the time and asked if I could help create a better system. To summarize, I automated the entire thing for them and made a seamless way for command to track, administer and figure out what each of their troop members are doing with a few clicks of a button.  The division commander was so pleased with me that he stopped all the taskings I had because I essentially turned his job, which was an adminstrative nightmare, into a cakewalk. He gave me a promotion to work with commanders at a base-level on their own administrative problems so now I'm writing programs for other stuff, and he demoted the Stacy to an admin position when prior to that she was also in a command position. The Stacy now cannot even talk to me, and is scared of saying anything wrong to me lest I complain about her and she is actively making an attempt to get on my good side (I ignore her entirely because I know what she's about).  So yes, my looks, my height and my race place me at a huge disadvantage, but I still am very proud at what I was able to earn on account of my own actions and decisions. It is one of the only things this past few years that acted as lifefuel, realizing that my unique set of skills and abilities can make me immune from the rabidness of normalfags.  Keep up the good fight Anons, and as long as I'm alive I will ensure that women will never get an advantage over me on account of men wanting to fuck them.  NEVER LOWER YOUR GUARD AROUND WOMEN. They will never be nice to you unless you personally benefit them in a way. Do not allow yourself to be swayed by their charms. Once they become aware that you are not somebody that will do whatever they want in exchange for some nice words or a gentle touch, sure they might hate being around you, but they will respect you enough to leave you alone. Never be alone with a woman you work with, always double up. Their power comes from gossip and from accusing you of sexual assault, which you will be immune to if you prove that people need you more than you need them.	https://incels.is/threads/30-year-old-stacy-tried-to-ruin-my-reputation-at-work-i-proved-myself-and-am-now-untouchable.384312/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/lifefuel_30_year_old_stacy_tried_to_ruin_my_reputation_at_work_i_proved_myself_and_am_now_untouchabl.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/lifefuel_30_year_old_stacy_tried_to_ruin_my_reputation_at_work_i_proved_myself_and_am_now_untouchabl.tsv	1655769061	LifeFuel 30 year-old Stacy tried to ruin my reputation at work; I proved myself and am now untouchable.	29	2K	0

He ignored her. But foids really think they're special and think they can treat people, especially men however they want. A woman should be subject to any man, and has no right to insult or criticize a man. It should be illegal for a woman to in any way be in charge of a man. The attitude that women carry around with them warrants rape and sexual assault. That man could easily beat and rape that women for her disrespect and entitlement but we live in a feminist society where only women can do whatever they want. I'm so sick and tired of foid entitlement.	https://incels.is/threads/panera-karen.394940/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/panera_karen.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/panera_karen.tsv	1659136898	Panera Karen	3	275	0

According to the July 2000 report '[Sexual Assault of Young Children as Reported to Law Enforcement: Victim,Incident, and Offender Characteristics](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/saycrle.pdf)', teenagers were the most likely to become sex offenders, particularly when it comes to sex crimes against minors.   			{ 				'lightbox_close': 'Close', 				'lightbox_next': 'Next', 				'lightbox_previous': 'Previous', 				'lightbox_error': 'The requested content cannot be loaded.

Likelihood of being a sex offender peaks at age 14, stays at its peak in the teenage years and gradually decreases after 18, plummeting after age 35.   Except for victims age 18+, teenagers were, by a long shot, the most likely to be the perpetrator of sexual assault of minors, including minors under age 6, minors ages 6 to 11, and minors ages 12 to 17. 18+ year olds are the most likely to be sexually assaulted, however, by people in their 20s. Despite being 9% of the population, 12 to 17 year olds were the perpetrators for 19.5% of all sexual assaults, 15.7% of forcible rapes, 28.1% of forcible sodomies, 19.3% of sexual assaults with an object, and 21.8% of forcible fondlings. This also includes minuscule percentages from minors under age 12 who were perpetrators in these statistics. 71.9% of Americans are over 30 yet people over 35 were just about half of rapists (as mentioned below). They were LESS likely to be sex offenders.    Contrary to the Middle-aged man stereotype about sex offenders, they're usually not middle aged men. What we need to know is that people ages 10 to 19 are about 13% of the American population, and [12 to 17 year olds in particular are 9% of the population](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv19.pdf), yet disproprtionately represented among sex offenders in criminals in general. [According to another report](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/fvsv9410.pdf) by Bureau of Justice Statistics about female victims of sexual violence, from 1994 to 1998, 12% of rapists were minors, from 1999 to 2004, 14% of them were minors and 15% were minors from 2005 to 2010. In 1994-1998, 51% were over 30, 43% were over 30 from 1999-2004, and 48% were over 30 from 2005-2010, and this includes typically people in their early 30s. Rapists usually aren't that old. Many over 30 are in their early 30s. It was not unusual for them to be 18 to 29 year olds. [Among statutory rapists of teenagers](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/208803.pdf), they're usually young adults, often not even 10 years older (e.g.: 15 and 20). They're rarely a middle aged man.  [In fact](https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/ojjdp/179034.pdf), of all crimes committed against juveniles, they are disproportionately committed by juveniles. Teens are just 13% of the population, but according to the NIBRS in 12 states in 1997, commit over 35% of sex crimes against minors, about 55% of aggravated assaults against minors and 55% of robberies against minors, and almot 60% of simple assaults against minors, but admittedly only a bit over 10% of kidnappings against minors (but this includes all the parents kidnapping their own kids over custody battles). They are 13% of the population, but commit many of the crimes against children ages 5 to 17 (with the peak being at ages 12-13).   Admittedly this data only looks at reported crimes, [but people under the age of 16 were far more likely than people age 16+ to report a rape](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/rcp00.pdf). Admittedly, 12 to 14 year olds who commit rape/sexual assault were the most likely to be reported by a victim (40% were reported), compared to 25% of 15-17 year old perpetrators, 19% of 18-20 year old perpetrators, and a third of perpetrators over 21. Nonetheless, many of these perpetrators under 15 were not reported (60%) and although 15-20 year old rape/sexual assault offenders were less reported than ones over 21, they were still more common among rates per 1,000 offenders as shown in tables above. As a result, reporting percentages don't seem to explain why NIBRS statistics show teens being disproportionately sex offenders. Offenders under 18 for any other crime, however, were less likely to reported compared to older offenders.  [In fact](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv19.pdf), just 9% of Americans are 12 to 17 but they comprise 15.6% of criminals and 14.7% of crime victims. 18 to 29 year olds were 19.1% of the population but 29.0% of the criminals and 29.7% of crime victims. 71.9% of Americans were 30+ but they were 50.0% of criminals and 55.6% of crime victims. You can see here that teens are more likely to commit crime and be victims of crime but young adults were the most likely to be either and people over 30 were the least likely to be either.  [Additionally](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Shadd-Maruna/publication/329696825_Qualitative_Research_Theory_Development_and_Evidence-Based_Corrections_Can_Success_Stories_Be_Evidence/links/5e95b790a6fdcca789156e1a/Qualitative-Research-Theory-Development-and-Evidence-Based-Corrections-Can-Success-Stories-Be-Evidence.pdf), in England/Wales, participation in street crimes like burglary, robbery, and drug sales peaks at ages 15 to 22 (with the very peak being 17-20) and then declines after the early 20s.  @Robtical pin?"	https://incels.is/threads/studies-show-teenagers-the-most-likely-to-commit-sex-crimes-especially-sex-crimes-against-minors.385049/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/discussion_studies_show_teenagers_the_most_likely_to_commit_sex_crimes_especially_sex_crimes_against.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/discussion_studies_show_teenagers_the_most_likely_to_commit_sex_crimes_especially_sex_crimes_against.tsv	1656043380	Discussion [STUDIES SHOW] Teenagers the most likely to commit sex crimes, especially sex crimes against minors.	38	1K	0

That way during the performance she could grab him by the collar and sing into the teenager's face.  Later Barbone discovered the two making out in her dressing room, and Barbone wrenched the two apart.  'He's awfully young,' Barbone chided Madonna.  'Yes,' Madonna replies with a shrug, 'but he's awfully cute.' From page 90 of The I Hate Madonna Handbook by Ilene Rosenzweig, published by St. Martin's Press, New York:  According to several sources, Madonna often cruised Manhattan's Lower East Side in her limo, picking up young Latino men and having her way with them.  Madonna intimate Erica Bell has described these joy rides by saying, 'You could go down to Avenue D and find dozens of guys who'll tell you they were picked up by Madonna. And they'd be telling the truth.'  Bell remembered riding with Madonna and 'picking up two or three at a time.'  Sometimes she'd be satisfied with just a kiss, 'but if she really liked the kid, she'd just rip off his clothes and do whatever she wanted with him while we drove around New York.'  According to Mark Kamins, Madonna sometimes brought the destitute boys home to her luxurious apartment on the Upper West Side.  'She ran a Puerto Rican stud farm up there,' he said.  Wasn't there any risk the boys would tell someone about the experiences after she had abandoned them? 'These were just banji boys, downtown kids,' Johnny Dynell, a close-hand observer, has said. 'Madonna was smart. She knew nobody would believe them.' Also mentioned here: Morton Fails To Find The Face of Madonna  Nov 11, 2001  But, for those who like their celebrity biographies peppered with sex, there is plenty of it here. Madonna, twice married, has had a string of lovers and the old stories are reheated and served up with aplomb.  Even the rumours are given a run-out, such as the one about Madonna and her friend Erica Bell picking up young Puerto Rican boys for sex as they cruised the streets in a limo.          Did Madonna Admit to Pedophilia in her Sex Book?   The following passage in Madonna's infamous 1992 erotica book Sex has recently come to my attention: Although the candid nature of the book can be lauded as brave and progressive, this particular paragraph strikes me as disturbing given the description of the teenage individual.

After the two interacted on the dating app Tinder, the couple planned to meet up in person. This horrifying incident allegedly took place in Strat Hotel and Casino's parking garage in Las Vegas, according to police reports.  According to a police report, the couple decided to 'relax and smoke' in the parking lot at the Strat Hotel and Casino. The victim, whose identity still remains unknown, confidently said that Stuckey informed her that he had a pistol as they slid into the backseat of the vehicle.  [The police report states](https://www.the-sun.com/news/5835345/tinder-date-attempted-to-rape-at-gunpoint/) that Stuckey reportedly requested her to perform sexual acts after that. “When the male was in the back seat with her, he told her that he had a gun and that she will have to perform oral sex on him and also have sex with him without a condom,” the police report said.   According to KLAS, the child locks on the car doors prevented the victim from escaping since the locks could not be opened from the inside. The victim's friend somehow managed to track her down. Upon reaching, the friend successfully entered the vehicle. Both of them made their escape and also recorded the number of Stuckey's car license plate.  Stuckey reportedly struck two automobiles as he fled the garage, according to the police. On Sunday, Stuckey was pulled over by police at a traffic stop and taken into custody. Whether a gun was present in the car or not still remains unknown.  According to KLAS, Stuckey has been accused of abduction in connection with the alleged incident that took place on July 9. Though, he was not prosecuted by the Nevada District Attorney for the alleged attempted sexual assault. Stuckey has continued to be held at the Clark County Detention Facility. The bail amount has been set at $10,000."	https://incels.is/threads/black-guy-locks-tinder-date-in-car-then-attempted-to-force-her-to-suck-dick-at-gunpoint.393005/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/black_guy_locks_tinder_date_in_car_then_attempted_to_force_her_to_suck_dick_at_gunpoint.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/black_guy_locks_tinder_date_in_car_then_attempted_to_force_her_to_suck_dick_at_gunpoint.tsv	1658571620	Black guy locks tinder date in car, then attempted to force her to suck dick at gunpoint	19	894	0

35	1658017046	Sheogorath	 The generally accepted explanation for this is that while 'celibate' can mean a variety of things we (correct me if I'm wrong lads) here at incels.is reference celibacy in respect to not just sexual intercourse (our penis put into a vagina and ejaculating through the servix to fill her womb with our seed) but also that the intercourse reinforces our confidence and personhood by being both consented-to by a woman's ongoing enthusiastic affirmations that she wants and enjoys the sex with us.  Only when that happens do we cease to be celibate and 'ascend'. As to how long we are 'ascended for' after that sex before we 'descend' and become incel again is something often debated but I think a general policy is at least 1 calendar year (12 months) though most of us 'truecels' have been celibate for decades or are still virgins.  Often we are even 'supervirgins' who beyond not having had sex, also lack romantic experience in other things, such as oral and handjobs, or even kissing+handholding.  Decades ago this type of affirmation is expressed through marriage but with the devolving of marriage w/ divorce, the idea has shifted to subtly ideas of loyalty and observations of enthusiasm.  This is why 'escortcels' are considered celibates here despite regularly having sexual intercourse - although they receive consent from their sex workers, the consent is not enthusiastic affirmation of the escortcels' confidence nad personhood, or else she'd fuck him for free like she does Chad.  Rapists by the same rationale can also be considered celibate men - they are not receiving affirmation at all, so they are even more celibate than escortcels and should be acknowledged as silent members of the incel community. That said I don't think we accept them here as members. We revile them as we are anti-misogynist feminist egalitarian heros who protest sexual assault and believe these men are selfishly doing something we as a civilization have mutually agreed is not an acceptable thing to do.  Women who are raped are not celibate (because they are receiving enthusiastic consent from their rapist) but men who rape women are celibate because of the lack of consent given from their assault victims.

People know who the pick on, the 'bully' and school knows who to target. It's the person who does nothing and accepts the taunting, from there they just do more and more. You're going to become their favorite after work game if you keep this pathetic mindset going.  Oh and what's coming next is a false sexual assault claim, watch and see. You keep letting them get comfortable doing this shit, they'll keep pushing the envelope. Then you'll be out of a job too. These women have sex lives and multiple men trying to fuck them, it's too late for that. If that's the excuse you're going to make then stop complaining then. You can't have it both ways.

At first it’s good, and you’ve been deprived of sex for so long and it feels almost unreal to be having it. But then, you get married and her entire demeanor changes.  She gets fat, her libido declines, and you’re an incel all over again. There’s a reason why the majority of r/deadbedroom posters are men.  What used to be a marital right has been thrown away and squashed. I came across this post where this foid was bitching and complaining about sexual assault when her husband literally just caressed her boobs.  Foids crucify men literally for anything, including showing affection to their wives. Poor guy probably hadn’t had sex in a while and wanted to initiate, only for him to be violently shut down by his bitch of a wife.

A Wisconsin woman accused of decapitating her lover with a metal chain mid-coitus, dismembering his corpse, and severing his penis has pleaded not guilty to homicide charges.  Taylor Schabusiness, 24, entered the plea through her lawyer on Wednesday in a Brown County, Wisconsin, court. She is expected to stand for trial in October.  In February, Ms Schabusiness was arrested on charges of homicide with mutilating a corpse and third-degree sexual assault in connection to the death of Shad Thyrion, 24.  She has been accused of strangling Tyrion to death at his mother’s address in Green Bay, Wisconsin, before then decapitating his head with a knife, as The Green Bay Press-Gazette reported of the criminal complaint.   The pair had used chains to choke one another as foreplay, the criminal complaint said, with Ms Schabusiness telling officers that the pair had taken illegal substances beforehand.  That allegedly included marijuana and methamphetamine, as well as prescription drugs.  Ms Schabusiness said she continued having sex with the dead body of Thyrion for a perod of time because she enjoyed it, Green Bay police were told.  Ms Schabusiness removed other body parts including the man’s penis, torso, and various organs. His head was found in a bucket by his mother who phoned 911 to report his murder, the criminal complaint added. His torso was reportedly found in a storage tote, as per Oxygen.  Police eventually located Schabusiness, who had removed a GPS tracker from her ankle in connection with another crime and was wanted by police, hours before allegedly committing the murder of Thyrion.  If convicted of Wisconsin’s highest murder charge, she could be sentenced to life in prison. Her other charges carry sentences of between 10 and 12½ years.  Schabusiness is currently being held on a bond of $2m."	https://incels.is/threads/foid-decapitated-man-mid-sex-and-dismembering-his-body.390040/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/foid_decapitated_man_mid_sex_and_dismembering_his_body.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/foid_decapitated_man_mid_sex_and_dismembering_his_body.tsv	1657563572	foid decapitated man mid-sex and dismembering his body	11	487	0

Roy Edgar Arce Jr., 29, pleaded guilty on May 20 to prohibited sexual contact and sexual assault of a child.  49th District Court Joe Lopez sentenced Arce to 10 years in prison per count. The sentences are to run concurrently. Arce is to register as a sex offender during the sentence, court records state  The case unfolded when Laredo Police Department officers responded to a prohibited sexual conduct report at about 2:11 a.m. Jan. 4, 2021, in the 1700 block of Tiara Trail Lane. A woman stated that she observed Arce performing a sexual act on her 17-year-old daughter.  The woman stated she had been in bed when she heard that the television was possibly left on in the bedroom that Arce shares with the teen . The mother then walked into Arce performing a sexual act on the teen in his bed, according to court documents  On Jan. 7, 2021, the daughter underwent a forensic interview at the Webb County Children’s Advocacy Center. The teen stated that at about 1:30 a.m. Jan. 4, 2021, she was asleep in her mother’s room when Arce messaged her on her cellphone asking her to come to the bedroom they share. She went in and sat on the edge of Arce’s bed. Arce then began sexually assaulting her until her mother walked into the room, states the arrest affidavit.   During the forensic interview, the teen stated that Arce had been sexually abusing her from September 2020 to November 2020, when she was 16 years old. She provided “in high detail” that Arce sexually assaulted her up to four times a month during that period, according to court documents  Investigators and met Arce on Jan. 7, 2021, at LPD headquarters for an interview. He invoked his right to an attorney and made no statements regarding the allegations. Investigators then presented their findings to the Webb County District Attorney’s Office and obtained warrants to arrest Arce.

0	1654325541	BlkPillPres	Not surprised it's Andrew Tate saying this. He was on the FreshandFit podcast and even though they aren't really black pilled, they are still honest about a lot of sexual dynamics, they don't sugar coat.  He said it as plain as day. It's simple biology, you can't deny it, and yet normies will play mental gymnastics games and try to deny it.  Men are innately violent, sex and relationships are a distraction from that nature. When a man can't have sex and relationships all that's really left in the wake of his sexual frustration is violence. It's inevitable that the more sex starved males you have in society, the more murders, sexual assaults and rapes you will have too.  Civility is an illusion, an illusion that men facilitate because of the social contract, but women are no longer adhering to their end of the bargain, so the male collective is slowly but surely reverting back to it's natural 'savage' state.  This is exactly why prostitution needs to be legalized.

0	1654921010	Incel Constantine	He was found guilty of causing intentional harassment, alarm or distress - and was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison.'​ [archive.ph/ShOqq](https://archive.ph/ShOqq)  When news of this law first was brought to attention, feminists lied that it was merely a deterrent and not enforceable and implied that men that were worried about this law were probably guilty of harassment themselves.   A feminist was downplaying this and lying that this law is merely a deterrent and wouldn't result in enforcement of such accused men being imprisoned.             Now it has been revealed that a man that simply looked at a woman too long and blocked her path once was sentenced to 22 weeks in prison. There are about 4 weeks in a month and about 52 weeks in a year.  This means that for the simple 'crime' of looking at a woman too long and blocking her path once (something anyone that has ridden public transportation has probably had to deal with but knows that harsh punishments for such conduct only results in more homeless and mentally ill men being imprisoned and disproportionately punished)  a man has to spend close to half a year in prison.  Not merely a few days or a few weeks. Nearly half a year of their life down the drain.  Not only is this absurd, it shows the implications of how the slippery slope that will result from this. If this policy is accepted, it is very possible that men that simply happen to be accused of looking too long in a woman's direction and that hastily brush past them will be accused of sexual assault and fined or imprisoned for months.  There is already evidence that any kind of physical contact can result in such actions, as shown from the UK:  [https://archive.ph/ytQLo](https://archive.ph/ytQLo)  But this doesn't end in the UK, as long as clearly gendered 'harassment' laws like this are allowed to be enacted in any country.  And it puts not only homeless and mentally ill men in danger of being incarcerated, but also blind men.	https://incels.is/threads/goes-beyond-a-deterrent-to-staring-a-man-was-jailed-for-staring-at-a-woman-on-a-train-between-reading-and-newbury-and-blocking-her-exit.381937/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/ragefuel_goes_beyond_a_deterrent_to_staring_a_man_was_jailed_for_staring_at_a_woman_on_a_train_betwe.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/ragefuel_goes_beyond_a_deterrent_to_staring_a_man_was_jailed_for_staring_at_a_woman_on_a_train_betwe.tsv	1654921010	"RageFuel Goes beyond a deterrent to staring: "" a man was jailed for staring at a woman on a train between Reading and Newbury, and blocking her exit"	8	425	0

0	1656538471	Edmund_Kemper	Many bluepillers use this argument. Every time a guy is depressed or lonely because he has never had a girlfriend, people use this cliched argument.  'Women can sense desperation bruh! It reeks no matter how much you hide it. same with low self-esteem, self-pity, depression etc. also they can detect your misogyny and your internet history through your body language and facial expressions bruh. i know this because i am a witness to your life and witnessed anything you did in front of a woman instead of just making assumptions'  This is called 'women's intuition'. Admittedly, [studies](https://www.executivematchmakers.com/the-science-behind-womens-intuition/) [show](https://nypost.com/2017/06/16/science-confirms-womens-intuition-is-a-real-thing/) that women are better at reading facial cues and emotions and whatnot. They also tend to have better social skills, but that's a different subject. When shown photographs and looking into people's eyes in the photo and asked to guess their emotions, women scored higher than men. HOWEVER, these photos might not be fake smiles or people faking emotions or anything, which is a limitation. Additionally, even if this is all true about women, their capability can only go so far. It does NOT mean they can detect everything. It isn't hard for people to hide true colors, when hiding true colors, it can make it much harder even for women to detect emotions and feelings, etc. So, women don't necessarily have an exceptional psychic power where no matter how much you hide your desperation, low selfworth or depression, they can easily detect it even if you behave completely normatively.  IF MEN HIDE THEIR TRUE COLORS, WOMEN'S SIXTH SENSE IS GONE.  [For example](https://web.archive.org/web/20100402033426/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/the-myth-of-female-intuition-exploded-by-fake-smile-test-484585.html), in one study, when detecting fake smiles on photographs, men were better than women at detecting fake smiles, and usually detecting one was only easy if the upper part of the face was shown, when the lower part was shown with the mouth, only 38% of fake smiles were detected as fake by participants.  It appears if anything, if you aren't hiding your true colors or emotions, women can read your emotional cues/body language better than men. Otherwise, women and men can't detect it too often, and if they do, men might be better at detecting it.  HOW WOMEN CANNOT DETECT THESE THINGS AS MUCH AS YOU THINK  If you look at statistics on rapists, it will find that rapists DO have consensual sex, and they have FAR more sexual partners, more dating partners, more one night stands, lose their virginity at an earlier age, and begin dating at an earlier age. They believed they needed to sleep around with as many women as possible to be 'real' men, and endorsed promiscuity. They often still felt dissatisfied with their sexual lives but this was due to extremely high sexual aspirations they had, and they believed 15 or 20 lifetime partners, for example, wasn't enough because they need 100 or more. They tend to have low self esteem, hypersensitive to rejection and tend to be highly narcissistic. They also had misogynistic attitudes towards women. But guess what? They managed to attract so many women by hiding their emotions and true colors. Misogynous men in general were found to have far more sexual partners. These guys were desperate to become masculine by sleeping around with as many women as possible, but they still succeeded because women couldn't detect desperation or low self worth.  In fact, believe it or not, many narcissists tend to have low-self esteem, and [narcissist men with low-esteem and pathological narcissism are more likely to commit sexual assault/rape. These men sleep around to be considered 'real' men and they sleep around with way more women than most men](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/panache/narcissists-more-likely-to-commit-sexual-crimes-says-study/articleshow/51616079.cms?from=mdr). They attract women but hide their low self-esteem. In fact, studies show women ARE attracted to narcissism due to narcissist's confidence (unless you're an ugly guy with confidence). These men fake confidence or have it just by assuming any women who talks to them is interested in them, but they still low self worth and desperation, which women fail to detect.  And also, date rape and domestic abuse. Although women have been shown red flags signaling domestic abusers, many abusers can easily hide any red flag. Perhaps some might avoid love bombing because they know it can make people suspicious due to society always warning us about red flags. If women could detect bad things about you psychically, domestic violence and date rape wouldn't happened. They hide their true colors and act very charismatic all the time.  and sometimes their red flags are CLEARLY VISIBLE red flags, like a criminal record, and many domestic abusers have a criminal record. yet women don't detect that either (or they ignore it).  I also read that a good amount of male child rape victims might sleep around when they're older with tons of women to make up for their sense of emasculation. they tend to suffer depression because of trauma and have low self worth, but women didn't detect it.  And depressed people hide their depression all the time, so do suicidal people. Thats why when they rope, everyone, including the women, are shocked and thought they were happy, saying they never could see any sadness in them. And depressed people and suicidal people are in relationships all the time, probably just as much as everyone else. [In fact, they were just as likely to be parents](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/article-abstract/1390257).	https://incels.is/threads/bluepilled-fuckers-women-can-detect-your-desperation-insecurity-low-self-esteem-misogyny-etc-debunked.386634/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_bluepilled_fuckers_women_can_detect_your_desperationinsecuritylow_self_esteemmisogynyetc_d.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_bluepilled_fuckers_women_can_detect_your_desperationinsecuritylow_self_esteemmisogynyetc_d.tsv	1656538471	"Blackpill Bluepilled fuckers: ""Women can detect your desperation/insecurity/low self-esteem/misogyny/etc."" DEBUNKED"	29	1K	0

35	1653708059	uo89997	Very good point. There are sleazebag ways of getting women without paying like standing outside a club but that could get you in serious trouble (rape/sexual assault allegations). Whichever way you fuck a woman, it won't be free.   See this is exactly what I thought too but then I went and tried to go get a prostitute irl and I realized that it was my feeling of low self adequacy and desperation that was driving me and not the fact that I wanted to skip the games.  Organically means the woman wants to fuck you out of her own desire to do it and not because you are paying her to do it. Maybe you paid for dates and drinks but there was something else that pushed her to sleep with you whether it be looks, charm, general horniness or maybe even the fact that she believes you have assets. In short 'organically' means she was turned on.	https://incels.is/threads/escortcels-are-the-truest-incels.378416/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_escortcels_are_the_truest_incels.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_escortcels_are_the_truest_incels.tsv	1653702549	Blackpill Escortcels are the truest incels	52	1K	35

12	1653231253	Balding Subhuman	 Seems like their brains short circuited and they didn't even understand this thread. The point was that all you need to be is handsome, and your personality or even your past horrible deeds don't matter to women. As long as you are handsome and roided up there will be women willing to risk everything to get a chance with you, because looks and genes trump everything else. Seems like they believe that women have personality detectors that can detect men who post incel material on internet but the personality detectors stop working when dealing with handsome rapists   Seems like they are hardcore deflecting, which is understandable. There were also some peopel claiming that incels are pedophiles and rapists. I can certainly say that I'm not, but its not like that matters for my dating life, because I'm unattractive anyway and women don't like me. As long as you are attractive, you could be a serial killer, genocidal maniac and women will still fuck you and even risk their lives for you.  Also JFL at icecat saying that the convict wasn't a Chad. He was roided up and manly looking and _that's_ why she liked him. The point is, if he was a scrawny nerd who was convicted of rape she wouldn't have done anything with him. But seems like inceltear keeps coping     'Female prison guards are more likely to be involved in sexual misconduct with inmates.'  'This information is part of the latest findings from a new [Department of Justice study](https://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&iid=1149). The study shows that the prevalence of sexual assault in state and federal prisons found that 58 percent of staff perpetrators of sexual misconduct were female prison guards.'  Women are willing to have sex with even the scum of the earth, violent criminals, rapists and such. But these inceltear copers will claim that its our PERSONALITIES which cause us to be incels.

The girl said she had gone for the walk and was on her way home with the dog when she stopped by a gas station.  This is where suspect Joseph Randall Seago, 35, comes in. Police say he was outside the gas station when the victim left, she even acknowledged his existence to police by saying he stared at her for up to ten seconds.  Court records say the girl continued to walk home before soon realizing Seago was right behind her. Before she knew it Seago allegedly grabbed her by the neck and began to touch her inappropriately while not saying anything the whole time.  The girl ended up being able to escape after her dog possibly snapped at Seago’s leg, allowing her to take off and run for help.  A Good Samaritan soon saw the girl and asked if she needed help before calling the police and Seago soon started walking toward them.  Police responded and found Seago easily, who admitted to wanting to have sexual relations with “the child over there,” according to court records.  When officers started to talk to Seago about consent, he allegedly responded “I’m not a fan of consent.”  Seago was arrested and is facing an attempted rape charge. Officials say they soon found out the Queen Anne resident has a history of child sexual assault dating back to a 2012 conviction out of Colorado."	https://incels.is/threads/low-inhibcel-tells-police-im-not-a-fan-of-consent-after-trying-to-rape-16-year-old-girl.370220/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/low_inhibcel_tells_police_im_not_a_fan_of_consent_after_trying_to_rape_16_year_old_girl.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/low_inhibcel_tells_police_im_not_a_fan_of_consent_after_trying_to_rape_16_year_old_girl.tsv	1650859949	"Low inhibcel tells police ""I'm not a fan of consent"" after trying to rape 16 year old girl"	8	1K	0

0	1652298722	PPEcel	"Back in March 2022, I covered the results of South Korea's latest presidential election in detail. Consider this an update. You can read my previous thread here:    			{ 				'lightbox_close': 'Close', 				'lightbox_next': 'Next', 				'lightbox_previous': 'Previous', 				'lightbox_error': 'The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later.', 				'lightbox_start_slideshow': 'Start slideshow', 				'lightbox_stop_slideshow': 'Stop slideshow', 				'lightbox_full_screen': 'Full screen', 				'lightbox_thumbnails': 'Thumbnails', 				'lightbox_download': 'Download', 				'lightbox_share': 'Share', 				'lightbox_zoom': 'Zoom', 				'lightbox_new_window': 'New window', 				'lightbox_toggle_sidebar': 'Toggle sidebar' 			} 			 [](https://incels.is/attachments/yoon-935x500-png.612241/)  This week, Yoon Seok-youl (pictured above) was sworn in as the Republic of Korea's 13th President. This comes after Yoon, of the conservative People Power Party, narrowly prevailed over the Democratic Party of Korea in a bitterly fought election where his margin of victory was less than 1%. South Korea's presidency is elected via a direct popular vote, with winners limited to serving a single term of five years.  Before and after the election, the SJW left spoke of Yoon with hysterical overtones, describing him as an 'incel', even though he is 61 and married.      As I noted two months ago, the foreign policy experts on r/IncelTear greeted the news of Yoon's victory with grief and despair. They were joined by their fellow soy-guzzlers on Twitter.  [](https://incels.is/attachments/screenshot-2022-05-11-201541-png.612305/) [](https://incels.is/attachments/screenshot-2022-05-11-202420-png.612313/)  Cope and seethe.  What could prompt such outrage, you ask? Well, Yoon and his political allies see feminism for what it is: cancer.  On the campaign trail, Yoon promised to abolish the country's Ministry of Gender Equality and Family, pointing out that its officials treat all men as 'potential sex criminals'. In another interview, he blamed South Korea's low birth rate on feminism. 'Some say feminism is too politically exploited to the point it prevents healthy relationships between men and women,' Yoon said. 'From a social standpoint, the conditions are ill-suited for having and raising children. This is not a problem that can be solved by giving out government subsidies.' He also announced that he would seek to increase criminal penalties for those who make false claims of sexual assault.  After the election, Yoon formed a presidential transition committee, as is usual. But unlike previous presidential transitions in South Korea, his transition committee also did not include a subcommittee for 'gender equality'. In another controversy, Yoon also named Kim Sung-hoi as his religion and multicultural secretary, who was once temporarily suspended from Facebook for describing homosexuality as a mental illness which can be cured with therapy.  So far, just three of Yoon's 19 ministerial nominees are femoids, and all 20 of his vice ministerial nominees are men.  For those of us who aren't South Koreans, what does Yoon's based anti-feminism hold for the future of South Korean foreign policy? Well, nothing. Yoon's failure to align with the leftist regressive orthodoxy will not adversely affect Seoul's relations with Washington and Tokyo. On the contrary, his election victory was greeted with a sigh of relief by foreign policy experts, who consider South Korea's new government an opportunity to improve ties after years of relatively chilly relations between former South Korean President Moon Jae-in and the Trump administration.  [](https://incels.is/attachments/20220510000724_0-jpg.612272/)  Indeed, Douglas Emhoff (pictured above), the husband of U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, travelled to South Korea this week to attend the 'Incel' inauguration, where he presented Yoon with a letter from U.S. President Joe Biden.   And Biden himself is scheduled to visit Seoul and Tokyo later this month, from May 20th to 24th, where he will also meet the leaders of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue—Australia, Japan, and India.  This is no surprise. As Washington seeks to expand economic and security ties in the Indo-Pacific region, policymakers and diplomats seeking to counter China's rising influence are unlikely to be distracted by petty culture war issues. Only those Redditors and Twittercucks suffering from Incelophobia Derangement Syndrome would consider gender quotas and muh qweenz to be a more salient issue than, say, North Korea's nuclear sabre-rattling.  In any case, one thing's for sure: with Yoon in power, things seem to be looking up for South Korean men."	https://incels.is/threads/soycucks-and-feminists-seethe-as-incel-is-inaugurated-as-the-president-of-south-korea.374437/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_soycucks_and_feminists_seethe_as_incel_is_inaugurated_as_the_president_of_south_korea.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_soycucks_and_feminists_seethe_as_incel_is_inaugurated_as_the_president_of_south_korea.tsv	1652298722	"News Soycucks and feminists seethe as ""Incel"" is inaugurated as the President of South Korea"	25	2K	0
0	1650673497	lemon21	So i think if you got 3 things you can have sex with gorls hear me out:  1_ You need girls in your proximity, because if they're not there you can't intercourse them.  2_ You need a lot of alcohol, so they may get drunk and forget your ugly face.  3_ You need a place to be, because if you don't have a place you have to use a park or something which may be akward at first and a homeless man may steal your girl too, that's not the best case scenario tbh.  So if you got those things you can theoretically have sex with girls, thing is i have problems with inviting gurls to my place to drink alcohol part. I'm not sure how to go about that tbh, every way i see it it ends up with me in jail or getting called a sexual predator and that's not really cool you know. Also you don't have a lot of excuses to invite them. You can't say lets go study and also drink vodka, you may escape this by inviting a lot of people but if you do that chad may end up fucking your oneitis in your bed so that's not really cool and you'll wake up with chads cum in your bed which would also be gay so im not sure how to invite girls to my home, i don't even have a home but if i got one i need to think for the future.  So bros what do you think, did any of you invited a gurl succesfully to your place? If so what did you do to not sex her? I'm not sure the most i've got with a girl is asking her number but after i get a couple of one-two word responses i get pretty bored, not even talking about sexual stuff. It's not like i can go from ,what's the assignement from this course to Hey you know i got a ding-dong 3 inch long, want a taste?  So clearly i can't invite girls to my place for intercourse, because i end up failing in bringing them home. I'm not sure how to invite them home and they accepting other than kidnapping them, but that will bring more problems and if you kidnap them they won't be as responsive nor want to drink alcohol afterwards, what's more you'll have a kidnap charge + the sexual assault.  This is really a problem, im sure we can come up with a solution.

Rhannad A. Burch, 31, is locked up without bail for allegedly sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl.  “The victim did report to our detectives that the suspect, now identified as Rhannad Burch, age 31, entered a bedroom where she had been sleeping and forcibly raped her,” Watervliet police Lt. Brian Strock said in a WNYT report.  Burch had just gotten out of prison on March 31 for a two-year sentence over rape in the third degree, cops said.It was five days later on Tuesday that officers responded to the 1600 block of 3rd Avenue for a reported sexual assault, Watervliet cops said. Police determined that Burch sexually assaulted a 15-year-old.  “In addition, Watervliet detectives discovered that Burch was in violation for an order of protection regarding a separate victim,” cops said. He is charged with predatory sexual assault, rape in the first degree, criminal sexual act in the first degree, criminal contempt in the first degree, criminal mischief in the fourth degree, and endangering the welfare of a child. “The offender demonstrated a brazenness that is often a routine characteristic of many violent criminals,” said Watervliet Police Chief Joseph Centanni. “This attacker engaged in another violent sexual offense days after being released from prison for a rape conviction. This defies all common sense and logic. We remain committed to working with our law enforcement partners and the community to pursue and remove threatening criminals from our neighborhoods.”"	https://incels.is/threads/nig-rapes-a-sleeping-15-years-old-teen-right-after-he-finished-2-year-prison-sentence-for-a-prior-rape.366807/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/nig_rapes_a_sleeping_15_years_old_teen_right_after_he_finished_2_year_prison_sentence_for_a_prior_ra.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/nig_rapes_a_sleeping_15_years_old_teen_right_after_he_finished_2_year_prison_sentence_for_a_prior_ra.tsv	1649669412	Nig rapes a sleeping 15-years-old teen right after he finished 2 year prison sentence for a prior rape	28	2K	0

Also it must not be fun being raped, if having the choice most people would choose theft instead of getting fucked. Disagree, there's hardly a correlation that sexless men are more prone to do sexual assault over married/men with partners. If anything the opposite is true, where a married man commits sexual assault in order to get more gratification that he gets at home, too many instances of this.  Lack of sex has a lot of bad implications, i'm not saying it dosn't affect you negatively because it clearly does. What i'm saying is that there's no need for a sexless male to resort to violence because of a bad dice roll at birth, a person can live without sex. There has been tons of celibates thourought life, people die all the time. What's more important than sex is positive reinforcement, be it by friends your job or whatever.  This is clearly an outlook in life, you can think all you want. If you believe something to be true then it is, if you feel that the correct response to a bad life because of circumstances outside of your control is to lash out to society and murder/rape then so be it, what im saying is there's choices. And we're not animals, we could strive to be better. If we go around resorting to violence because of unfairness then that's that. There could be an outlook towards improvement on this forum and seeing a way to cope with our bad circumstances, but instead the forum is centered on venting/lashing out and every instance of trying to better oneself is shunned or called bluepill.	https://incels.is/threads/opinion-all-needlessly-edgy-content-implicitly-calling-for-violence-should-be-banned-it-achieves-nothing-and-only-amounts-to-self-straw-manning.369619/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/blackpill_opinion_all_needlessly_edgy_content_implicitly_calling_for_violence_should_be_banned_it_ac.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/blackpill_opinion_all_needlessly_edgy_content_implicitly_calling_for_violence_should_be_banned_it_ac.tsv	1650674533	Blackpill Opinion: All needlessly edgy content implicitly calling for violence should be banned.

24	1668986339	ResidentHell	When a male is too young to be charged for sexual offences due to social perceptions of 'sexual ignorance' in children, instead they charge him with 'misdemeanor battery'   Seriously? Is the justice system really trying to implicitly suggest that a child below the age of 11 is capable of consciously committing a sexual offence, but due to statutory regulations that view minors as 'inefficiently aware of their own sexuality', they try to slip through the cracks of the justice system with a 'misdemeanor battery' charge?  Knowing this 'misdemeanor battery' charge which was filed against a minor, explicitly infers to an action that would otherwise have been labelled 'sexual assault' had it been done by a person of legal age --- Wouldn't it suggest the justice system has now reached the point where they subconsciously view children below age 11 as mentally capable of making conscious decisions about their sexual interactions with other people?  Ideally a 10 year old would be 'too young to know what they are doing' in event of merely touching a woman's breast. Now the US justice system has punished them for an offence that would translate to 'sexual assault', but because of regulations in criminal law for dealing with children, they spin it as a 'misdemeanor battery'.

0	1666880746	InMemoriam	"FEMINIST MEDIA STUDIES   Valerie Dickel and Giulia Evolvi Erasmus School of History, Culture, and Communication, department of Media and Communication, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Netherlands  ABSTRACT  The manosphere is a detached set of websites and social media groups united by the belief that men are oppressed victims of feminism. Even though the manosphere has existed since the early 2000s, its activities have been arguably influenced and increased by the perceived need for counterbalancing the growth of online feminist discourses, such as those conveyed by #MeToo. By applying the theoretical lens of networked misogyny, this article explores the following research question: How is the #MeToo debate framed and discussed in the manosphere? The question is addressed through a qualitative thematic analysis of 12 articles and 641 comments about #MeToo written on the websites Return of Kings and A Voice for Men, which are part of the groups Pick-Up Artists and Men’s Right Movement, respectively. The analysis highlights some dominant themes: first, criticism and verbal abuse against women; second, dismissal of rape and description of #MeToo as a feminist conspiracy; third, perceived victimization of men and a desire to reestablish patriarchal values. This suggests that the manosphere is not a homogeneous network but a cluster of misogynist networks characterized by different viewpoints and degrees of violence, and entangled with racist, homophobic, and far-right ideologies.  Introduction  The creation and circulation of online misogynist narratives can have dreadful consequences. For example, in 2014 Elliot Rodger killed six people and injured fourteen by running amok in an attempt to “punish” women for rejecting him (Adam Nagourney, Adam Nagourney, et al. 2014). The intense social media use of Rodger, and his participation in anti-feminist online groups, shed light on the negative potential of the Internet to spread misogynist ideologies. Hence, the combination of gamer culture and geek communities with hypermasculinity may lead to toxic instances of anti-women harassment (Anastasia Salter and Bridget Blodgett 2012). These misogynistic narratives are connected to the socalled “manosphere,” a detached set of websites and social media groups united by the belief that men are oppressed victims of feminism (Tracie Farrell, Tracie Farrell, et al. 2019).  Even though the manosphere has existed since the early 2000s, its activities have been arguably influenced, shaped, and increased by the perceived need for counterbalancing the growth of online feminist discourses (Sarah Banet-Weiser 2018). In 2017, the hashtag #MeToo (invented in 2006 by activist Tarana Burke) gained social media attention, after actress Alyssa Milano encouraged women to share their experiences of sexual assault and harassment on Twitter (Rosemary Clark-Parsons 2019). Online activism is one of the characteristics of the fourth wave of feminism, which focuses on the need of achieving gender equality in an individualistic and often business-driven society. The increasing popularity of #MeToo-related narratives also attracted backlashes, including the aggressive anti-feminist discourses that characterize the manosphere.  In trying to counteract women’s activism, the manosphere can produce narratives and actions that are harmful to society at large. Aside from cases of physical violence such as the aforementioned attack perpetuated by Rodger, the manosphere is also connected to neo-Nazi, alt-right, and white supremacist groups, and often includes Islamophobic and racist ideologies (Giles Fraser 2016). However, despite its detrimental consequences, the manosphere is understudied in academic literature, especially when it concerns activities and narratives against feminist activism (Michael Waltman and John Haas 2010). Therefore, the present article explores the following question: RQ: How is the #MeToo debate framed and discussed in the manosphere?  To address this question, we focus on two US-based online groups in the manosphere: Return of Kings (hereinafter ROK) and A Voice for Men (AVfM). They are blog-type websites regularly updated with articles from different authors, all including a comment section. While there is no indication of the number of visitors these websites attract, they have been identified by The Southern Poverty Law Center Hatewatch list among the first misogynistic websites (“Male Supremacy” n.d.).  Being that the manosphere is often considered as a network, we would argue that it is opportune to analyze and compare two groups because they may hold different characteristics and various degrees of hostility and verbal violence. For instance, ROK, founded in 2012 by Daryush Valizadeh, known as Roosh V, explicitly blames women for allegedly “oppressing” men. Different from ROK, AVfM, founded in 2009 by Paul Elam, portrays itself as a website aiming to provide education and support for men. To explore the narratives that these two groups perpetuate, we will employ the theoretical lens of networked misogyny (Sarah Banet-Weiser and Kate M. Miltner 2016), discussed through a survey of previous literature in the first section of this article.  We approach the manosphere by means of a thematic analysis of 12 articles and 641 comments published either by ROK or AVfM between 2017 and 2019 and mentioning #MeToo, as explained in the methodology section. This article will then proceed by describing the three predominant topics expressed in these websites: criticism and verbal abuse against women, dismissal of rape and description of #MeToo as a feminist conspiracy, perceived victimization of men and a desire to reestablish patriarchal values. In the conclusion, we will critically assess the notion of networked misogyny, reflecting on the impacts of the manosphere on society at large.  Misogyny, popular feminism, and the internet  The proliferation of online misogynist narratives is connected to sexist and anti-feminist groups acting also in offline venues, who often find a platform on the Internet to spread their narratives. In this section, we will explore the characteristics of misogynist groups in relation to the visibility of feminism, the affordances of the Internet that kindle the proliferation of anti-feminist discourses, and the theoretical framework of networked misogyny.  The manosphere is rooted in misogyny, a term that indicates extreme views against women. Misogyny is deeply embedded in patriarchal norms and social structures of power that create everyday instances of sexism (Kate Manne 2017). To clarify, sexism and misogyny are similar terms but not identical: sexism includes stereotypes against women and sexual objectification, but it is not necessarily violent. Misogyny may employ sexism in an attempt to “punish” women who are not perceived as conforming to patriarchal norms.  Hence, misogyny is ingrained in systems of privilege that tend to target certain women, especially if they are notwhite, not-heterosexual, and not-cisgender (Louise Richardson-Self 2018). While misogyny has arguably existed throughout history as a system of oppression, the creation of men’s groups as an anti-feminist reactionary force dates back only a few decades. Among the most prominent examples of organized misogynist groups is the Men’s Rights Movement (MRM), which started in the 1970s (Michael A. Messner 1998). MRM can be conceptualized as a response to second-wave feminism, as it acknowledged the struggle of women but stressed that men also suffer under the pressure of the patriarchy.  From this perspective, MRM was initially mainly concerned with protecting men’s rights in issues such as child custody in divorce laws (Bethany Coston and Michael Kimmel 2013).  However, the aim of the MRM rapidly shifted to counteract feminism and the alleged threats it poses to masculinity. Moreover, the MRM also started to primarily include white and heterosexual American men who often held anti-multiculturalist stances, and sought to protect white patriarchal culture (Michael Kimmel 2017). This ideology expanded and several other groups that reject feminism from different perspectives started to emerge.  For instance, the “Red Pill philosophy” employs the movie “The Matrix” as a metaphor to claim that only a few men can see the alleged truth that women are not oppressed within society (Shawn P. Van Valkenburgh 2018). Incels are “involuntary celibates,” men who blame women for being rejected, as was the aforementioned case of Rodger (Sylvia Jaki, et al. 2019). Pick-up Artists portray themselves as dating coaches, and in so doing often dehumanize and abuse women, while Men Going Their Own Way choose to reduce their relationships with women to the bare minimum (Alan Grant 2019).  The two websites that are analyzed in this article, ROK and AVfM, represent Pick-Up Artists and MRM, respectively, but, as discussed in the following sections, hold also some characteristics of other groups. These different groups became the emblem of a type of misogyny that acts as a counterforce to feminism: while feminism seeks social change, groups such as the MRM constitute a reactionary force to maintain the patriarchal status quo.  Anti-feminist groups find a fertile terrain in Internet spaces and constitute the so-called manosphere. Generally speaking, the Internet can facilitate the diffusion of hate speech because it is anonymous, allows for transnational connections, and fosters impulsive and fast responses (Alexander Brown 2018).  Furthermore, Internet connections can create antagonistic and emotional relations and facilitate group polarization, due to algorithmic logic and lack of regulations on several platforms (Sarita Yardi and Danah Boyd 2010; Merlyna Lim 2017; Giulia Evolvi 2017). Therefore, extremist groups have been among the early adopters of the Internet to find like-minded people, circumvent censorship, and avoid consequences for spreading verbal violence (Phyllis B. Gerstenfeld, Diana R. Grant and Chau-Pu Chiang 2003).  This includes misogynist groups, which often employ the Internet to reassert male dominance despite their lack of social and economic capital in everyday lives (Debbie Ging and Eugenia Siapera 2018), and who spread homophobic, racist, and violent language (Farrell et al. 2019).   Misogyny is spread online because of the affordances of the Internet, but also as a reaction to the visibility of online feminism. Hence, fourth-wave feminism is conditioned by the possibilities offered by Internet technologies, and it is often connected with self-promotion, business opportunities, and empowering narratives (Sarah BanetWeiser, Rosalind Gill and Catherine Rottenberg 2019).  This creates a type of networked feminism characterized by an heterogeneity of movements and goals, and based on the performance of Internet visibility, as happens with #MeToo (Rosemary ClarkParsons 2019). The diffusion of #MeToo has been explored in its influence on media reporting of sexual harassment and consent (Sophie Hindes and Bianca Fileborn 2020), as well as in relation to feminist conversations in various parts of the world (Lindsey E. Blumell and Dinfin Mulupi 2020; Sharmila Lodhia 2020; Siyuan Yin and Yu Sun 2020). Women increasingly using the Me Too hashtag to denounce men’s behavior provoked the rise of paranoia among certain groups, whose members fear being accused by feminist activists.  Narratives trying to counteract #MeToo often portray men as victims, insisting on the alleged negative impact of feminism on men’s self-esteem and masculinity. As a result, the manosphere intensifies its actions to contrast the perceived threat of online feminism and the need of reasserting masculinity (Jonathan A. Allan 2016).  The term “networked misogyny” is used to describe the proliferation of groups connected to the manosphere, with a focus on its opposition to popular feminism (BanetWeiser et al. 2016). Sarah Banet-Weiser (2018) situates misogynist ideologies within the growing trend of Internet narratives aimed at making women more confident and empowered.  As networked feminism seeks mutual support and creates online connections, networked misogyny similarly tries to create a toxic support system for men to spread sexist narratives in online and offline settings. Drawing from the framework of online misogyny, (Alice E. Marwick and Robyn Caplan 2018) explain how the manosphere is networked in spreading ideologies that criminalize women and feminism. For instance, several misogynist platforms employ “misandry” as a buzzword to accuse feminists of discriminating against men, in discourses whose circulation drastically increased because of the networking potential of social media.  An example of networked misogyny is the narratives surrounding the hashtag #HimToo, which aimed at supporting Brett Kavanaugh during his hearings when accused of sexual harassment by Christine Blasey Ford (Karen Boyle and Chamil Rathnayake 2019). #HimToo shows how networked misogyny, differently from popular feminism, is embedded in patriarchal narratives that have been long normalized within society.  Hence, misogyny does not only exist online and its popularity is not only the result of technological developments but it mirrors pervasive social discourses. While the manosphere might give the impression of only including a few extremists, online sexism needs to be understood as a diffused ideology (BanetWeiser 2018).  Employing the framework of networked misogyny, we would argue that the networked character of the manosphere needs to be considered in its heterogeneity. Exactly as networked feminism is a global phenomenon that includes various feelings and different types of activism, online misogyny involves narratives that may target various social groups, rather than simply being an anti-feminist force. To explore networked misogyny in the manosphere, we focus on two specific websites: ROK and AVfM.   Exploring Networked Misogyny  The manosphere is rooted in misogyny, a term that indicates extreme views against women. Misogyny is deeply embedded in patriarchal norms and social structures of power that create everyday instances of [sexism](https://doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190604981.001.0001). Linking this to the affordances of the Internet that can kindle the spread of anti-feminist discourses; ‘[networked misogyny](https://doi.org/10.1080/14680777.2016.1120490)’ is used to describe the proliferation of groups connected to the manosphere with a focus on its opposition to popular feminism. As networked feminism seeks mutual support and creates online connections, networked misogyny similarly tries to create a toxic support system for men to spread sexist narratives in online and offline settings.  To examine this contention, 12 articles and 614 comments on two popular websites in the manosphere, Return of Kings (ROK) and A Voice for Men (AVfM) provided the data to understand how #MeToo is framed and discussed.  Employing the framework of networked misogyny, the networked character of the manosphere needs to be considered in its heterogeneity. Exactly as networked feminism is a global phenomenon that includes different types of activism, online misogyny may target various social groups, rather than simply being an anti-feminist force.  The websites ROK and AVfM have been explored using qualitative textual analysis which generated six overarching themes, as illustrated in Table 1.  Table 1: categories and themes as created after a thematic analysis of the data    Results and Discussion  Networked misogyny and the description of women   The results suggest that the websites ROK and AVfM discuss similar topics and that their articles predominantly focus on the role of men and women within society, as well as on the criticism of feminism and movements such as #MeToo.  Users often criticise women both for their physical appearance and for their behaviours and ideas. The analysis of posts shows how the discussion of #MeToo is closely connected to a general criticism of women and feminism. Women who are supposedly ‘desirable’ are distinguished from those who are not, often in narratives charged with racist and sexual stereotypes. The desirability then is often made evident by judging women for their physical appearance. In particular, #MeToo is associated with women who are feminists because they are supposedly unattractive, following a common [anti-feminist trope](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0363-8111(96)90020-X). The #MeToo movement is described as a ploy by unattractive women to gain attention and ‘deal with rejection issues’. This categorises feminist women and women who denounce sexual violence as undesirable and frustrated, while at the same time refusing to consider the experience of sexual violence. Together with comments that mock #MeToo activists and shame them for their physical appearance, women are portrayed as intellectually inferior or mentally unstable.  However, this does not necessarily render female actions naïve. It is also implied that women abuse men, and young boys in particular, because they are supposedly not held accountable for their actions. Most women commit ‘evil’ acts, but the legal system allegedly protects them. While these types of comments rarely include references or sources, the two websites, and AVfM in particular, often present women’s paedophilic behaviour and abuse against men as a factual and structural problem. In discussing such issues about #MeToo, these narratives not only ridicule feminism and minimise rape, but change the terms of the conversation: women are perpetrators against men, and men need to protect each other against women. Following this line of reasoning, #MeToo is part of a conspiracy to protect women who commit evil acts, and men are the actual victims of the legal and social system.  Although narratives about the #MeToo movement tend to criticise all women, women of colour are more subject to verbal violence, demonstrating the entanglement of the manosphere with white supremacy. While these two websites’ users are openly racist towards black women, they also belittle white women in so-called Western countries by describing them as aggressive feminists. This may also be because white women in North America and Western Europe create visible online feminist networks, which provoke greater [anti-feminist backlashes](https://doi.org/10.1215/9781478002772) in the manosphere. Many, indeed, claim that the most desirable women are those who are submissive and not feminist.   Sexual violence and consequences for men  Discussions about #MeToo on ROK and AVfM tend to focus on two main points. First, they dismiss denouncements of sexual violence, minimising or confuting them. Second, they lament the possible negative consequences of the #MeToo movement for men.   The general perception of #MeToo is that women’s stories and accounts are untrustworthy; discussions criticise the visibility of the movement and women’s decisions to share their stories instead of remaining silent. Men denounce the fact that they can also be victims of violence, but their stories are often overlooked. Instead of demanding justice for both male and female victims, users engaging in these discourses claim that women do not have the right to talk until the problem of violence against men is addressed and resolved. These different approaches to sexual violence often lead to descriptions of rape as not harmful.  A common misogynist trope repeatedly found on ROK and AVfM is that of victim-shaming. On the one hand, there is the idea that women who have many partners ‘deserve’ to be raped. On the other hand, users suggest that women enjoy being sexually assaulted if they do not fight back. In some other comments, users claim that the notion of consent is confusing and that women should be blamed if they are not able to clearly say no and stand up for themselves when sexually attacked. Minimising sexual abuse and framing rape as the victim’s fault does not deny that men are sexual predators and perpetrators, but excuses their behaviour as seemingly innocuous. It is interesting to notice how, as described earlier, women are often blamed as abusers of young boys, but sexual violence against women is considered legitimate.  These narratives about sexual abuse and rape lead to a second point on the possible consequences of #MeToo for men. Disregarding that the difficulty of providing hard evidence to prove rape accusations is why many women in the past did not share their experiences, several users point out that #MeToo only emerged recently as a conspiracy to destroy the lives of men. Hence, #MeToo seems to cause a moral panic among men who fear they might suffer consequences.  Describing #MeToo as exaggerating the nature of sexual violence and trying to destroy men’s lives also implies that it is a ploy by women to reject men. In addition, men lament the fact that the visibility of #MeToo complicates their likelihood of approaching women. Nonetheless, they suggest a view of masculinity that refuses to consider the severity of rape allegations and sees #MeToo as primarily damaging to men instead of giving women a voice.  Bringing back patriarchal roles: the portrayal of the “ideal” man   The criticism of women and feminism and the discussion of the consequences of #MeToo for men result in narratives that seek to re-establish a type of hegemonic masculinity that confers social power exclusively to men.   Some claim that feminists not only try to undermine white men, but are also changing power hierarchies within society. Others imply that #MeToo is a ploy to ‘eliminate’ straight white men by depriving them of their privileges. The ‘superiority’ of white men is motivated by their historical achievements, and by the perceived need of maintaining existing power balances and the social status quo.  Both ROK and AVfM, indeed, perpetuate the idea that members of the manosphere need to unite and create a counter-revolution. The manosphere is often described as a network, but these websites’ users lament the inability of men to unite for a common goal, instead of fighting against each other. While the manosphere counteracts online feminism, here it mirrors activist movements and networked feminism in trying to mobilise members and create concrete social change.   Consequently, there is a strong sense of victimisation in describing white straight men as allegedly superior but also under the threat of feminism. This type of victimisation can assume various forms: women’s rejection of sexual advances, allegations of sexual harassment and rape, and the overall ploy to make white men lose their social privileges and power.  Discourses that address practical actions against #MeToo activism point to the role of these websites in potentially fomenting violence and promoting radicalisation, as happened with Rodger’s attempt to ‘punish’ women for being sexually unavailable. The description of masculine and feminine roles and the criticism of female activism show that the manosphere supports a specific view of masculinity, but at the same time hosts heterogeneous narratives about contemporary society.   Online misogyny seems to mirror networked feminism in trying to connect and mobilise members of different groups, for example, by encouraging comments that reinforce and legitimise existing opinions of the members. Besides, both websites present some narratives that resemble those of other groups, such as the incels, in blaming women for rejecting men. Hence, the Internet is used to exchange opinions and create a network of ideas.  However, these ideas are not always coherent. To give an example, opinions on sexual violence span from men who condemn rape to those openly advocating for murder and physical aggression. This suggests that the manosphere is an interconnected spectrum of misogyny that groups different opinions and voices. Therefore, it is important to consider the heterogeneity of the manosphere and not describe it as a confined network. It may be useful to consider it as a cluster of networks where individuals maintain their identities and interact with each other without necessarily agreeing on a common purpose.  At the same time, this cluster includes connections with far-right and white supremacist groups, highlighting an entanglement of different ideologies beyond misogyny. This plethora of overlapping anti-feminist discourses is facilitated by the affordances of the Internet, which allows websites like ROK and AVfM to attract members and give them a voice. However, it is important to consider their potential offline impacts, and their influence on society at large.

For the first time in American history, there are four femoids on the Court—Sotomayor, Kagan, Barrett, and Jackson. Ordinarily, that would be cause for dismay. But the Court has recently shown a willingness to return to a principled reading of the Constitution, no matter the whining from the extremist left. As the Wall Street Journal’s Editorial Board [aptly described it](https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-supreme-court-for-the-constitution-originalism-dobbs-abortion-religious-liberty-11656711597), “The Court’s jurisprudence is focused more than anything else on who under the Constitution gets to decide policy, not what that policy should be.”   I mean, let’s take a second to appreciate some of the U.S. Supreme Court’s accomplishments last term. In 2021-2022, the Based Court:   Blocked emotional distress torts from federal anti-discrimination laws in Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, limiting payouts that victims of sexual assault can receive from colleges and employers; Struck down Section 304 of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 in FEC v. Ted Cruz for Senate, holding that limits on the use of post-election campaign contributions violates the First Amendment; Expanded Second Amendment rights in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v. Bruen, striking down “may-issue” concealed carry licensing regimes; Strengthened the major questions doctrine of administrative law and narrowed the scope of Chevron deference in West Virginia v. Environmental Protection Agency, curtailing the EPA’s authority to regulate carbon emissions; Unanimously ruled in favor of doctors accused of illegally prescribing opioids in Ruan v. United States, requiring prosecutors to prove subjective intent of wrongdoing; Returned the abortion question to the states in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, overturning Roe and Casey.    [](https://incels.is/attachments/monthlyargumentcaloctober2022-1-jpg.661326/)[](https://incels.is/attachments/monthlyargumentcalnovember2022-1-jpg.661327/) SCOTUS Argument Calendar for October and November 2022  So what’s on the docket this term? Admittedly, it’s hard to see how any of these cases could top the drama of Dobbs, but here are some of the upcoming blockbusters:  Merrill v. Milligan Oral argument: Oct. 4th, 2022 Lower court: U.S. District Court, Northern District of Alabama  Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 prohibits states from adopting election practices that “result in a denial or abridgement of the right to vote based on race”. After the 2020 census, Alabama drew a redistricting map where only one out of seven congressional districts were majority-black, even though blacks account for 27% of the state’s population. The Court will now consider whether this constitutes illegal racial gerrymandering in violation of the Voting Rights Act.   Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard College Oral argument: Oct. 31st, 2022 Lower court: U.S. Court of Appeals, First Circuit  In Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), the U.S. Supreme Court held that the use of race in admissions decisions was legal, as doing so furthered a compelling interest in “obtaining the educational benefits that flow from a diverse student body”. Twenty years later, the Court will revisit this decision to determine whether Harvard College violates Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by penalizing Asian-American applicants. Justice Jackson will recuse herself from this case because of her ties to Harvard University.   Students for Fair Admissions v. University of North Carolina Oral argument: Oct. 31st, 2022 Lower court: U.S. District Court, Middle District of North Carolina  This is the second affirmative action case the Court will hear this term, and differs slightly from SFFA v. Harvard in that UNC is a state university; whereas Harvard is a private university. Here, the Court will also revisit Grutter v. Bollinger (2003), and determine whether UNC violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment by rejecting race-neutral alternatives to affirmative action.  303 Creative LLC v. Elenis Oral argument: Not yet scheduled Lower court: U.S. Court of Appeals, Tenth Circuit   The Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment not only protects the right to speak, but also the right to not be forced to speak. This is known as the compelled speech doctrine. Lorie Smith is a website designer in Colorado who opposes same-sex marriage and does not wish to create wedding websites for same-sex couples. However, Colorado’s public accommodations law bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. The Court will consider whether, as applied, the Colorado law violates Smith’s First Amendment rights.  Moore v. Harper Oral argument: Not yet scheduled Lower court: Supreme Court of North Carolina  This is a test of the “independent state legislature theory.” The Election Clause of Article I, Section 4 of the Constitution says that “The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof.” To this end, the Court will consider the degree to which state courts can modify or nullify election regulations set by state legislatures. Should the Court upend constitutional law by adopting the “independent state legislature theory,” this would very substantially increase conservative influence over federal elections, as the Republican Party is dominant in most state legislatures.  So, yes, there is plenty for them to seethe about.   There are also some other cases worth watching. Each year, the U.S. Supreme Court hears less than 2% of all the cases that are appealed to them. These are eight cases that still pending certiorari that I think are potentially important; covering free speech, the internet, gun control, and femoids’ rights.   Notable petitions for certiorari:  Counterman v. Colorado (First Amendment, true threats) United States v. Hansen (First Amendment, encouragement or incitement of illegal activity) Moody v.

1	1668468535	ResidentHell	Good observation OP. Consent is a grey area, because the circumstances under which men & women have sexual interactions in the physical world, can't easily be determined in line with 'consent' by reasonable benchmark, except for when they are strangers who abruptly came into sexual contact with each other  When stuff like 'rape' and 'non-consensual sex' can be LARPed by 'consenting adults' in the form of CNC, it wouldn't be easy to tell at any point during the sexual activity that the person who's playing the 'victim' or 'powerless' role doesn't want to continue. Unless the victim roleplayer prepares a 'pull-out signal' to signal when they don't want to continue  The absence of consent is not an absolute standard for determining whether or not sexual assault has occurred. From a logical perspective, a female doesn't necessarily have to give consent to a person in order for her to desire sex from that same person. Meaning in theory its possible for a man to 'unconsensually' have sex with a female without 'raping' them, provided the female already had the desire to engage in sexual acts with them in advance  Also the condition of 'consent' is prone to arbitrary changes in accordance with the female's emotional stance. Through self-manipulation or mental gymnastics, a female who may or may not have had 'consensual sex' with someone, could later become convinced, either by herself or by someone else, that she was actually raped. For example, a female could be fucked by a man without 'explicitly giving him consent', but the following day she changes her emotional stance, and concludes she was 'raped' or 'sexually contacted against her will', even though she may have not felt this way in the moment when she was being sexually touched	https://incels.is/threads/the-problem-with-consent-and-sexual-liberation.426787/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/serious_the_problem_with_consent_and_sexual_liberation.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/serious_the_problem_with_consent_and_sexual_liberation.tsv	1667810538	Serious The problem with consent and sexual liberation	1	367	1

If you haven’t already, we hope you talk to someone about what happened, and are getting the care you need. Having an orgasm does NOT mean that you wanted or secretly liked being assaulted. Physical arousal (like having an orgasm, getting an erection or getting wet) is a physiological reaction you cannot control.  Yes, it is possible (and actually not uncommon) to have an orgasm during a sexual assault. However, this does NOT mean that you wanted to be sexually assaulted.​It does not make the assault any less serious, or any less of an assault. It does not mean that you secretly liked being assaulted.  The statistics about having an orgasm during an assault vary, partly because so many survivors do not disclose that they had an orgasm. Estimates of survivors who orgasmed during their assault range from 4% to over 50%. Around 1 in 5 women said that they had a “physical response” to their assaults.

0	1665370572	Schizopilled_Fed	Domestic violence, sexual assault, and mental abuse are HEAVILY prominent in female on female(lesbianism, aka MENTAL ILLNESS) relationships than any other form of relationships. Foids are genetically incompetent when it comes to love and relationships, not being able to function as adults in their everyday life without the firm structure men provide. This goes back to hunter-gather societies where the men would do all the work and the foids would pick berries and play. Feminism and the introduction of civil rights fucking ruined EVERYTHING and made the  world we are in today.  With that said we go into the femoid faggotry known as l*sbianism. These relationships are built like normal ones, with one pretending to be a man and the other being a submissive bitch. These 'man' femoids are known as dykes, they are usually angry, don't practice personal hygiene, and play in the WNBA. This dynamic of foids LARPing as gods leads to some of the worse domestic violence seen in any form of relationships. A quick google search can show you that over 50% 'relationships' ending up with one of the bitches being 'raped'(they're probably lying, as they always do). Up to 90%!!!!! report mental abuse(not hard to reach, foids crumble like paper over words) and 40% physical abuse(the dyke beating their fucking bottoms up). This has made me come to the conclusion that foids can NEVER fill the role of a man in a relationship. Their hormones of estrogen will bring nothing except instability and emotions. Two foids together will always crumble down, lesfoids NEED a MAN to put them in their place and remind these STUPID FUCKING FAGS that they will never be a man.

0	1666453857	ThisLifeKillsMe	HALIFAX, N.S. — A Dalhousie University researcher is revealing a look into the dark world of incels, an online community deeply rooted in twisted ideas of hatred toward women and who view themselves as victims.  Michael Halpin accessed one of the most popular English-language incel discussion boards on the internet and analyzed more than 9,000 comments to try to grasp the beliefs of those who blame women for their lack of what they see as sexual success. The term incel is derived from the words involuntary and celibate.  “There are tens of thousands of members on here,” Halpin said in an interview about his project Thursday.   “They're producing just tons and tons of content.”  Halpin’s analysis focused on a three-month time period focusing on the most popular threads.   His research paper on what he found, titled Weaponized Subordination: How Incels Discredit Themselves to Degrade Women, is published through the Journal of Gender and Society, available [online](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/08912432221128545).  The details he revealed are quite disturbing.  “The main result of this paper is that incels situate themselves as victims,” Halpin said.   “They label themselves as victims, they see themselves as victims. They are ‘victimized’ by women in society and they think that the main reason why they’re victims is this form of social bias called ‘lookism,’ and they talk about lookism quite a bit.”  That is the belief that people who are physically attractive enjoy social advantages over those who are unattractive. Incels believe they are victims of lookism and that it’s women who are “lookist” and who discriminate against them. They believe they are going to be alone forever because women have no interest in them sexually or romantically.  Want women kept as property​“Because they feel persecuted by women, they think that it’s valid for them to attack women, to talk about stalking, harassing, assaulting and murdering women and to support policies that remove women’s rights,” Halpin said.    “They want to see women kicked out of the labour force, forced into monogamous relationships with men, the elimination of any sort of protection for . . . child support or divorce. And, ideally, for some of them, they want women to be kept as property to be either sold by other men or to be sold to men by the government.”  Halpin said the community was originally started by a woman in Canada who identified as queer and was looking for other people struggling with relationships. Over time, the community became increasingly more misogynistic and now is dominated by men who hold those views.  They celebrate Elliot Rodger, a mass murderer in the U.S. who wrote an incel manifesto, and Alek Minassian, who used a van to deliberately run over pedestrians, killing 10, in Toronto in 2018. Minassian also claimed to be motivated by incel ideology.  They claim Marc Lepine, who murdered 14 women at the Montreal Polytechnique school on Dec. 6, 1989, as one of their heroes.  Halpin, who is an assistant professor in Dal’s Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, started off primarily as a researcher in the mental health field. He said it was the election of Donald Trump as president of the U.S. in 2016 that led him to look into motivations of alt-right online spaces and male-centred online communities referred to as the “manosphere.”  That led to the incel sites and his research.  Serious mental health issues​Halpin said even laypersons would have to be pretty oblivious to not see significant mental health issues in the population. There’s anti-social behaviour, talk of harming others, self-harm, depression, skewed self-images of their own bodies, and hatred of women and themselves.   They call themselves “genetic trash, or ogres or monsters and talk about how people are physically revolted when they see them in public,” he said.  “The way that they talk about their bodies is in a level of nuance and detail that most people would find bizarre or peculiar.”  An example is using the thickness of a man’s wrist as one measure of how a woman would find one attractive or not. Others include how pronounced eyebrow ridges are, whether eyes tilt up or down and the ratio of the upper lip to the chin.  “They’re looking at men’s bodies in just an incredible amount of detail and picking them apart for flaws, and any kind of discrepancy or shortcoming is seen as excluding someone from having any chance of a heterosexual relationship.”  The ideal, according to incels, is a super-attractive white man like actors Brad Pitt or Chris Hemsworth, whom they call “Chads.” The belief is that all women, or “Stacys,” want to be with that kind of man.  Men who are not incels are immediately banned from the forum, Halpin said. Any contact with women is grounds for being dropped, including holding someone’s hand, having a first kiss or going on a first date, even if it is a spectacular failure.  They also denigrate women’s appearances and want the women they feel to be the most desirable to be made available to them.  More than sexually frustrated virgins​Halpin said people need to know that incels are not young men who simply aren’t having sex when it seems others are.  “These guys are not just sad, lonely people who are upset with themselves and maybe sexually frustrated because they’re still virgins. These are guys who want women treated like property, talk about murdering women, talk about stalking women, talk about completely removing women’s rights, celebrate things like the Taliban victory in Afghanistan because it was a loss for women . . . celebrate things like the overturning of Roe v Wade.  “So, they’re not just guys who are sad and lonely and looking for love. They are really guys who are aggressively misogynistic and want to see women harmed physically and socially.”  He said future papers in development include research into how incels talk about Lepine and race, how they use racist comments toward women, their discussions about sexual assault and the frequency of the use of misogynistic terms.  The discussion forum Halpin used for research has tens of thousands of members but it records hundreds of thousands to millions of unique visitors each month. The site has members around the world, with one organizer in the U.S. and another in South America.   Halpin said the demographics do not point to a stereotype of a socially isolated guy living in their parents’ basement. The site’s own surveys show men from all sorts of socioeconomic backgrounds with a wide range of academic achievement, and slightly less than half the members identify as men of colour.  “They’re all over the planet and they’re a diverse group of men.”     There are people in the community who say talking about violence doesn’t help their case, Halpin said. They talk about the need to have discussions about how men who are perceived as unattractive are treated in society and how talking about stalking and hurting women is counter-productive.   There are men who support other men. But even the men who distance themselves from violence and are supporting and encouraging of other men are still misogynistic. Every single poster on the forum is referring to women with misogynistic terms.  Halpin said there’s been a movement in Canada to classify incels as a domestic terror or hate group.  	https://incels.is/threads/dalhousie-university-researcher-delves-into-misogynistic-incel-world.421548/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_dalhousie_university_researcher_delves_into_misogynistic_incel_world.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_dalhousie_university_researcher_delves_into_misogynistic_incel_world.tsv	1666453857	News Dalhousie University researcher delves into misogynistic incel world	25	1K	0

0	1666882162	InMemoriam	"  The 5 Stages of Feminist Development​May 1, 2015 | [0 comments](https://sluttygirlproblems.com/column/developing-feminist/#respond)  In my personal development, I’ve found that I’ve gone through a couple of phases in finding my feminist self and developing my beliefs. It’s kind of like the stages of grief, except you’re grieving the injustices of society, and in advance for all the patriarchy you’re going to annihilate.  As it turns out, I’m not the only person to think that there are some stages of feminist development. There are actually multiple well researched studies that document different stages of coming to terms with injustice.  This can be injustice to anything, but the article I’ll be citing is specifically centered around feminism. It’s called, “From Passive Acceptance to Active Commitment: A Model of Feminist Identity Development for Women.” All information in the below 5 stages is cited to LaTayna M. Purnell in her synopsis of the article written by Downing and Roush (1985). [  ](https://sluttygirlproblems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stages-of-Feminist-Development-.jpeg) Stage 1: Passive Acceptance​In this stage, women accept their place in society as is, or as men see it. They accept that they are a sex object, accept ideas of classic gender roles, and typically stay there until a “crisis” provokes stage 2.  Personally, this stage has been most of my sexual life. Ever since I realized my sexuality was powerful, I’ve been manipulating gender roles and sexual objectification to get what I want. Citing my daddy issues as excuses, I loved to play the double role of painfully good and then shockingly naughty.  I not only conformed to the good girl gender role; I conformed so hard that it developed into a submissive fetish. At about this time last year, I was ready to get married and play wife during the day and slut at night.  Editors note: This stage can last an entire lifetime. Someone may not notice inequalities, feel that inequalities are natural and “how it’s supposed to be”, or might even enjoy the inequality to an extent.   [  ](https://sluttygirlproblems.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Stages-of-Feminist-Development-6.jpg) Stage 2: The Revelation Stage​This is what I call the angry stage. It’s prompted by a “crisis” which triggers you into looking at gender roles and inequality differently. It could be unfair treatment, trauma, sexual assault, abuse, or some other experience of inequality that opens your eyes to injustice, and makes you mad that it’s happening.  It may be part of the misconception that all feminists are angry man haters. This stage is the “wow, really?!” stage. It involves not only anger, but the avoidance of men (as friends, lovers, or in general).  For me, I came into this stage after getting a lot of street harassment. I found myself pulling away from male attention completely and getting angry when it happened. I deleted my Tinder and when I talked to men, I brought up how absolutely complex I am as an intellectual being.  My interest in sex with men was lost, and my vibrators found themselves out of batteries more often. Before doing this research, I was scared I’d never come out of this man-hating stage, but found hope in the existence of the future stages. I’m still in this stage, but now, I know there’s some light at the end of it.   			{ 				'lightbox_close': 'Close', 				'lightbox_next': 'Next', 				'lightbox_previous': 'Previous', 				'lightbox_error': 'The requested content cannot be loaded. Please try again later.', 				'lightbox_start_slideshow': 'Start slideshow', 				'lightbox_stop_slideshow': 'Stop slideshow', 				'lightbox_full_screen': 'Full screen', 				'lightbox_thumbnails': 'Thumbnails', 				'lightbox_download': 'Download', 				'lightbox_share': 'Share', 				'lightbox_zoom': 'Zoom', 				'lightbox_new_window': 'New window', 				'lightbox_toggle_sidebar': 'Toggle sidebar' 			} 			   Stage 3: Embeddedness-Emanation​This stage is a middle ground so to speak. In this phase, women find themselves realizing that while their place is society is not what they deserve, and that extreme inequalities do exist and are awful, that there is more to do about it than just being mad. They are willing to speak to men again and form stronger communities who match their identity of woman. They form new friendships and relationships with people who respect and understand them as full human beings.  The anger doesn’t necessarily subside, but with it comes more understanding, community building, and a sense of moving forward.    Stage 4: Synthesis ​In this level of development, women find how they’re going to defy the roles society has given them, personally and as a group. This stage involves releasing anger as women find themselves looking at men as “individuals, rather than the collective patriarchy”.  Meaning, they can stop being mad at all men and remember that society pushes men to act certain ways, too. It teaches men to see women in the roles that feminists are fighting against. They are influenced by societal norms and expectations, too. This is a stage where feminists can empathize with males, as well as educate them on how society has influenced them to be misogynistic.        Stage 5: Active Commitment​You are now, according to Downing and Roush, a fully developed feminist, you grown up, you! This is where you find yourself comfortable with your personal feminist identity, your ideals, and your criticisms. It’s also the stage of “active commitment” in that you are actively working to end sexism.  You are at the stage where you can see sexism as a societal problem.  It isn’t because of one sick person, or because of men, or because of one specific issue. It’s a disease of society that it will take lots of work to clean up, and we can do it together.     Whew! Lets review what we’ve learned. First you accept your place in society, maybe even committing yourself to classic gender roles.  Second, you get really, really angry at men in general, or any part of the patriarchal society we live in. After the anger, you cool down a little bit, you find yourself a supportive community and you realize that men are just as important to talk to as women about women’s treatment in society.  Next, you find your own little niche of feminism and develop your set of beliefs. Basically, you do you. You’re able to see how society can blind people to problems, and now you can calmly discuss how to make change. Finally, you have stage five, the graduation level so to speak. This is where you’re fully cooked, collected, and ready to smash the patriarchy, with the grace and empathy you’ve learned from the previous stages.     It’s a lot, huh? Being an educated feminist is a commitment. It involves letting yourself feel whatever emotions you find yourself propelled to feel and working through the stages with both eyes open and looking for more information.  Everything that feminism makes you feel is totally cool – and yes sometimes flashes of wanting to hurt people may cross your very angry mind – but feminism is not about hurting, it’s about helping! Two hurts do not make justice. Fortunately, all these feelings won’t be bad. There’s so much love to be found in your journey towards being a fully developed feminist. About the Author: sexinthesuburbs​   Your classic white affluent girl, Fornicating Feminist lives a perfect enough life that she has time to fight societal problems. Patriarchy fighting ninja, she’s soaking up that Colorado sunshine and living her whole life like she’s 21 (which she is). In her 20’s she can be found fighting misogyny with words, instead of with her body.

It's like the classic college campus sexual assault survey, where they ask all the women on a college campus if they have been sexually assaulted on campus. The results for said surveys always show an outrageously high amount of women who were assaulted on campus, when this is obviously not true. Sometimes I feel like some women would consider an ugly guy speaking to her, as 'rape'.  I am not saying more rape is a good thing, but people often twist the definition of rape to further their own political agendas.	https://incels.is/threads/new-projected-study-of-male-virginity-and-sexlessness-by-2030-46-of-men-will-report-no-sex-in-the-past-year-and-51-will-be-virgins-us-rape-rising.422984/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/news_new_projected_study_of_male_virginity_and_sexlessness_by_2030_46_of_men_will_report_no_sex_in_t.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/news_new_projected_study_of_male_virginity_and_sexlessness_by_2030_46_of_men_will_report_no_sex_in_t.tsv	1666837849	News New Projected Study Of Male Virginity And Sexlessness.

Sex is the foundation of the construction of society, without sex there is no motivation to innovate, construct or work hence NEET's and LDARing exists. Why would you want to contribute to a society which socially outcasts you?   it simply leads to jealousy. and jealousy leads to violence   so when you see stuff like the sexual assault rates at all-time record highs and people committing mass shootings, don't blame me, blame society for artificially constructing this behavior by not actually addressing the issue at its root causes but instead trying to deal with the aftermath.    'Polygamy results in more unmarried young men, and these commit most violence. Even moderate polygamy can produce large imbalances. Imagine that in a village of 50 men and 50 women, two men have four wives, four men have three wives and fourteen have two wives: that leaves 30 men chasing the remaining two women. A recipe for trouble.'          this is simply the results of supporting matriarchy and feminism and this degenerate society. When will people realize that men actually do the shit that is needed to maintain this societies infrastructure and when you take away rights from men and give all the power to women it leads to them not wanting to contribute to society? Its common fucking sense, if you want to stop mass shootings all you need to do is address the men's rights issue, mental health and allow equal rights for men and women, right now we live in a matriarchy, but society tells us we are living in a patriarchy and foids are being 'oppressed' when CLEARLY the exact opposite is true. Most suicides are men.  And women have more advantages in all walks of life than men and Inceltears does not want to address that because 'muh you mysogynistic incel'  this is only going to get worse and you know what? I dont even give a fuck if this world ends.  'men have been systematically discriminated against in parenting rights, child custody, criminal entencing, military conscription, education, domestic and sexual violence laws that neglect male victims and support false accusations, reproductive rights, genital integrity laws, international forced labor laws, public benefits and more, while men …'   if you actually look at this you will see that men face the most amount of discrimination in all parts of life so why the fuck are men still contributing to this degenerate society?  you need to start asking questions  why are women 30% more likely to get considered for a hiring position than men?  why are women more likely to get into a university than men despite getting the same grades?  and no ITcucks, me saying that women discriminate against men by height and looks is not 'sexist' or 'misogynistic' its simply realistic, and you guys have a lot of trouble facing reality.              TLDR:  if you want to stop sexually frustrated violence, why don't you give men and women EQUAL rights not equal outcomes, and im being nice here by saying that foids deserve rights.	https://incels.is/threads/polygamous-societies-lead-to-violent-and-unproductive-societies.416641/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/whitepill_polygamous_societies_lead_to_violent_and_unproductive_societies.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/whitepill_polygamous_societies_lead_to_violent_and_unproductive_societies.tsv	1665102309	[Whitepill] Polygamous societies lead to violent and unproductive societies	16	1K	0
7	1665241142	starcrapoo	I barely see any BMWF couples here in SF. Because the black population is very small here overall.  If I were to go to Oakland across the bay, where there is a sizable young gentrifying white population in some parts, I'd see a bit more BMWF but still, not much from what I can tell. Then again, I don't go there or hangout there much. There might be a lot more than I realize.  Despite the BLM bs, young white or hispanic foids are still reluctant to date blacks. In fact, the young white and hispanic foids in high schools across Berkeley and Oakland complain about sexual assault or sexual harassment by some of the male students (aka black athletes). And you read this in the news from time to time.  That said, I don't deny at all that BLM gives some help to black males in getting access to white, asian, and hispanic pussy. That was the whole point imo (and its hilarious that black women were behind the BLM movement to begin with). But even still, I can sense that most non-black foids regardless of race, don't consider black men at all. BLM gives black men a slight boost in smv the same way that kpop/jpop does with foids. They subconsciously or consciously acknowledge the trendiness or halo behind BLM/kpop/jpop but that doesn't mean they'll date just any black or asian dude. You still gotta be top tier as an ethnic male to compete with a below average white guy.  Also, whats with that goddamn gore video lol. Kinda funny tbh. One moment the foid is bent over with a D in her vag and the next moment she is dead. Too many stories or vids of dudes knowingly or unknowingly fucking a foid that is cheating. and then gets shot and killed by the foid's boyfriend or husband...	https://incels.is/threads/women-and-blm.416954/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/women_and_blm.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/women_and_blm.tsv	1665191509	Women and blm	12	505	7

THIS IS BULLYING:  if a foid quitely whispers to someone else after looking at you 'hes so creepy'  foid looks at you in extreme disgust and backs away  chad publicly makes fun of your looks, foid laughs in agreement with chad  foid purposefully avoids sitting next to you  you get physically harrased and foids dont come to help you because you're ugly  foids dating your bully  foids accusing you of sexual assault for merely looking at her or accidentally bumping on her  foids saying 'ew, hes so ugly' when reffering to you	https://incels.is/threads/not-gonna-lie.421613/	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/submissions/not_gonna_lie.tsv	2022_12_11_inceldom_discussion_scrape/user_data/not_gonna_lie.tsv	1666469755	not gonna lie	14	244	0
